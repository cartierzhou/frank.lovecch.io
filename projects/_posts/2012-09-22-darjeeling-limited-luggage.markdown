`_The Darjeeling Limited_ resides on one of the most coveted lists in my head **\[of which there are many\]**: _Favorite Films_.` The movie is filled with many beautiful and memorable set-pieces, a few stood out to me (as good design rarely goes un-noticed):  the brother's suits, the deceased father's glasses, the J.L.W. luggage, and the passed-between-brothers matching belt.

I was not alone in my fascination with the film's set pieces, and while doing research for the luggage build, I stumbled onto quite a few blogs (and posted the most pertinent).  I always find it interesting to read many different posts on the same topic:

1. [Men's Flair](http://www.mensflair.com/celebrity-styles/the-darjeeling-limited-style.php)
1. [Graphic Sidebar](http://gdbar.blogspot.com/2008/04/darjeeling-limited.html)
1. [Purse Blog](http://www.purseblog.com/travel-gear/the-darjeeling-limited.html)
1. [The Baggage Claim](http://www.thebaggageclaim.me/2007/11/louis-vuitton-l-darjeeling-limited.html)
1. [Classic Driver](http://www.classicdriver.com/uk/magazine/3800.asp?id=13659)

My imagination went into hyper-drive after the first time I viewed the film; to this day I won't take my long-awaited locomotive trip across India without the items listed above in tow (though the soft luggage doesn't suit my taste).  Since the luggage and belt were one-of-a-kind, I decided to go into the luggage-making business, and maybe make a little money on [Etsy](http://etsy.com)

After examining the pictures scrupulously, I decided the initial design needed some changes, though only because of producability and cost issues:

<h2>[iteration 2]</h2>
It was nearing Christmas in _two-thousand and ten_, and I was walking from my parking space to work in the nearby Denver suburb of Stapleton when an unassuming bum approached me. He was taking donations in exchange for a local newspaper, called [The Voice](http://denvervoice.com). I flipped through it out of pity.

<h2>[open-source]</h2>
For almost _two_ years now, I've held onto a drawing of the animals **\[and the associated CAD files for stamps\]** without plans to share. I've never really planned on mass-producing the luggage I'm attempting to create, though; reflecting on why that is so, it seems there may be a motticum of hipster inside me keeping the beauty inside him. Since it just seems to be hypocritical to my lifestyle, I've chosen to share the files, albeit in an unconventional way**\[to most people\]**. 

The files are shared on `Github` under the \[GPL\] license. What does this mean?

1. Versioning. You can modify the files all you want, and keep this history (plus access to all the original files).
1. GPL - Don't be evil and such. Don't mass produce them, ya know?
