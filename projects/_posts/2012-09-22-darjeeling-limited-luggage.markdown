_The Darjeeling Limited_ captivated me from the beginning like no other Wes Anderson film has, `and it did so with style`. There are _two_ kinds of people **\[not _[ten](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/5aa9)_, as developers would have you believe\]**; those that saw the movie and recognized beauty in the form of luggage, and those that - sadly - did not. It was the only element of the film that outdid the wonderful depiction of human relationships.

`I was not alone in my fascination with the film's set pieces`, and while doing research for this project, stumbled onto quite a few blogs, of which these are the most pertinent:

1. [Men's Flair](http://www.mensflair.com/celebrity-styles/the-darjeeling-limited-style.php)
1. [Graphic Sidebar](http://gdbar.blogspot.com/2008/04/darjeeling-limited.html)

1. [Classic Driver](http://www.classicdriver.com/uk/magazine/3800.asp?id=13659)

My imagination runs rampant whenever the pieces cast their sprectum unto my eyes; `I murkily envision the day I take a long-awaited locomotive trip across India with a dame on my arm and suitcases in tow`. 

<h2>[the luggage business]</h2>
It's the hard pieces of the set I was most interested in; something about the messenger bags screamed `awkward`.

After examining the pictures scrupulously, I decided the initial design needed some changes, though only because of producability and cost issues:

<h2>[iteration 2]</h2>
It was nearing Christmas in _two-thousand and ten_, and I was walking from my parking space to work in the nearby Denver suburb of Stapleton when an unassuming bum approached me. He was taking donations in exchange for a local newspaper, called [The Voice](http://denvervoice.com). I flipped through it out of pity.

<h2>[open-source]</h2>
Sometime last year, I opened my inbox and came across an unexpected e-mail: `someone was actually interested in what I was doing`. I believe he was Brazilian, and inquired about the drawings for a project he was 

For almost _two_ years now, I've held onto a drawing of the animals **\[and the associated CAD files for stamps\]** without plans to share. I've never really planned on mass-producing the luggage I'm attempting to create, though; reflecting on why that is so, it seems there may be a motticum of hipster inside me keeping the beauty inside him. Since it just seems to be hypocritical to my lifestyle, I've chosen to share the files, albeit in an unconventional way**\[to most people\]**. 

The files are shared on `Github` under the \[GPL\] license. What does this mean?

1. Versioning. You can modify the files all you want, and keep this history (plus access to all the original files).
1. GPL - Don't be evil and such. Don't mass produce them, ya know?
