quote: Bartender-less booze.

Most people picture a little robot behind a bar pooring booze, when asked about an automated bartender.  Or, having spoken with a bartender at a casino, they reference the always broken maragarita machine.  In reality, a fully bartender-less bar is a lot simpler to implement (though still difficult), and does not involve an Asimovian robot pouring drinks and smiling creepily at you.  

The premise of an automated bar is simple, and can be viewed from two viewpoints: the consumer and the owner.  As an owner, I'm looking to reduce overhead costs (employee elimination, overpouring, theft) and provide a unique niche.  As a consumer, I want cheaper alcohol without a wait.  As a college consumer, I want to get wasted.  As human beings, we thrive on sociality - the bartender conversation/flirtation - something people have told me is the number one reason the bar would fail.  I completely disagree, and attitude is everything!

Over the course of my on-going, many-yeared research into this foray, I have stumbled upon different projects pertaining to automated bars - the most recent one being a legitimate wine bar, thus proving the concept.

Another one of the inspirations for the bar was originally located at a now defunct site - <a href="http://barmonkey.net">www.barmonkey.net</a>. From what I remember, I think Anthony Cervante was a part of this, but don't hold me to it.

I knew I wanted to open the world's first ([I think) automated bar ever since I had a fake I.D.  It was more of a dream at that point, but I could never stand waiting in ten minute long, 'I don't have boobs lines', for drinks.  The first step - after figuring out it was possible - was the location.  Having lived in Chicago for six years, I knew the neighborhoods very well, but I also knew the cost of renting a place in a decent-ish location:  expensive.  I've got this thing about "credit", so a mortgage was also out of the question.

I've been to every major college town within a few hours of Chicago, and from my experiences, originally wanted to open the bar at the University of Illinois.  A lot of things make sense about choosing the University of Illinois for the first version of the bar.

1) The plethora of engineering interns available, especially ones that like to drink (that would be nearly all of them, don't be fooled).  We're looking at lots of future engineers with few internships available on campus, and the bar is still going to need employees - door carders, machine restocking and maintenance, quick part swaps when something goes wrong, and of course - security.  Why not hire all engineers and computer kids for this?  Perfect.

2) Green street is perfect.  It's walking distance from every major housing establishment on campus, where every other bar is located, and where the drunk food be.  Who needs bar food when you have an IHOP a block away?! 

3) It's close enough to Chicago to have friends visit and shack up.  That's right, I'm looking out for ya boys.

4) Chambana bars don't change much, and they don't need to - the turnover rate is four to five years for students, so you're not looking at becoming outdated with flashy new bars going up all over and people getting sick of you.

The problems I didn't foresee with Chambana were liquor licenses and zoning.  The only place suitable for being used as a bar was being torn down in a couple years, and it had become nearly impossible to get a liquor license without serving food.  Talk about ridiculous bureaucracy!  

Moving forward, the plan is to open up a location at Iowa, University of.  I'm told (by some very smart alcoholics) that this truly is a great place for a beta bar.
