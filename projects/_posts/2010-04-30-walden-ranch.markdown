I visited Colorado for the first time in April of _two-thousand and eight_ on my last college spring break trip. It was then that I realized people are capable of choosing multiple places to call home over the course of their lifetime. Several months later, while living and working in Chicago, a friend and I decided to purchase _five_ acres in San Luis Valley...on a whim **\[and off of [Craiglist](http://craigslist.com), none-the-less\]**. `I would come to describe this whim as Manifest Destiny`, even if half-joking. 

My sister and I took a miserable there-and-back trip over that same Christmas holiday. We managed to sign the deed, get it notarized by the county, and make it back to Chicago in less than _forty-eight_ hours. Colorado, officially, became the second place I got to call home.

A few months after the purchase, I was laid off from my first real-world engineering job. Not long after, I set out on what would become a _three_ month journey of self-discovery **\[and grifting, which is where the title of this project comes from\]**. I had satellite radio, an Astro van full of power tools, and a map of the property; just the necessities. I arrived in the San Luis Valley during the scorching heat of August, threw on cowboy boots once purchased for a sorority barn dance, and started to dig.
