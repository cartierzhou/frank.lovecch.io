I visited Colorado for the first time in April of Two-thousand and Eight on my last college spring break trip. It was then that I realized people are capable of choosing multiple places to call 'home' over the course of their lifetime. Several months later, while living and working in Chicago, and friend and I decided to purchase five acres in San Luis Valley on a whim (and off Craigslist, none-the-less). Years later, I would come to describe this whim as 'Manifest Destiny'. My sister and I took a miserable three-day, there-and-back trip over that Christmas holiday to Southern Colorado; we managed to sign the deed, get it notarized by the county, and make it back to Chicago in less than forty-eight hours. Colorado, officially, became the second place I got to call 'home'.

A few months after the purchase, I was laid off from my first real-world engineering job. My lease expired in the city a couple months later, and I set out on what would become a three-month journey of design, building, and self-discovery. I left without really saying goodbye; I had satellite radio, an Astro van full of power tools, and a portable electric toilet. I arrived in the San Luis Valley during the scorching heat of August, threw on cowboy boots I had bought for a sorority barn dance, and started to plan.
