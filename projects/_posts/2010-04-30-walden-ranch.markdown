I visited Colorado for the first time in April of Two-thousand and Eight; everything changed. It was then that I fully realized people are capable of choosing multiple places to call 'home' over the course of their lifetime. Several months later, while living and working in Chicago, me and a friend decided to purchase five acres in San Luis Valley on a whim (and off Craigslist, none-the-less). Years later, I would come to describe the whim as 'Manifest Destiny'. My sister and I took a miserable three-day, there-and-back trip over the Christmas holiday weekend that year to Southern Colorado; we managed to sign the deed, get it notarized by the county, and make it back to Chicago in less than forty-eight hours. Colorado, officially, became the second place I got to call 'home'.

A few months after the purchase, I was laid off from my first real-world engineering job. My lease expired in Chicago a couple months later, and I set out on what would become a three-month journey of design, building, and self-discovery. I left without really saying goodbye; I had satellite radio, an Astro van full of power tools, and a portable electric toilet.

I arrived in the San Luis Valley during the scorching heat of August. I threw on my once-worn cowboy boots, and never really took them off until I left. The property is about three miles in from the highway (driving distance), and it's all dirt roads with protruding boulders - the area is one huge lava rock field. It took me a few hours to locate the actual piece of land and its subsequent markers (using the sub-division map I had received from the owner before me). I was able to find the markings by steering with a foot while a large portion of my body exteded from the open window; you might know it as 'ghost riding' your whip.

I changed and evolved the design even when I was building, and there is mulitple notebooks of calculations, price inquiries, and designs that I will post once I get a chance to scan everything. I'd like to take the phsyical copies and turn them into a coffee table book once the house is finished.
