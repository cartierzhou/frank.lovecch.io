I received a phone call one summer's afternoon in two-thousand and eight from a friend eating at <i>Chipoltle</i>; "I just read something on the back of my drink, and it reminded me of you". What he then read to me was the quotation above (in bold), and I couldn't have said it better myself! My projects are plentiful, costly, and broader than the scope of my life would allow. The never-ending list of interests comes from my quest to conquer the world in its entirety (or die trying, as the saying goes). I live by Ms. Frizzle's mantra, "Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!", and find greatness in failure - I hope you can too. 

I've found that my niche lies not just within bits and btyes, but in the combination of the digital and physical worlds. My belief in the free (or societal cost) of information resonates deeply, and why I choose to share my knowledge and with you.

Enjoy exploring. It's a magical world.
