<h2>[version 1]</h2>
My digital alarm clock reads 7:15 A.M. I needed an alarm outside of my cellphone because of the made-up sleeping disease I gave myself, the one where I routinely slept through mulptiple alarms. God-damned Day-Walkers. The room I'm sleeping in, if you can call it a room, is completely black with no windows; it's really a wireframe of a room, really, encapsulated on all sides by awfully-constructed walls with not much more than spackle holding them together. The alarm goes off. 

I bashed the alarm's Off button with a viciousness one could only have for a putrid device with a single desire to plunge me into the working world's hours, the jumped out of the slighty raised bed frame resting on top of two by fours. I unlock the door, then put my version of "wabaki" on - old Bauer shower sandals available only to hockey players at sporting good's shops.

I was always running late, and that menats a shower the moment I was up. The shower was located in the doorway of the garage, as it has one of the drains located near the door. 

Maybe I should explain this. My first apartment post-university was an older, two-story, detached carriage house, or coach house as some people refer, which was cleaned up and rented out as two separate units. The top floor was a studio apartment, the bottom floor was a garage space with a bathroom. The main property was an empty business front and apartment; the neighborhood was Old Irving, and still rather sketchy.  

I rented the place stating that this was for a "business venture" and "hobby projects", but 

, and had four curtain rods with respective curtains e turns on the slop sink located immediately outside his bedroom, and uses a Sharpie-drawn black line on the faucet as a guide for temperature regulation.  The camera follows the hose from the slop sink to the shower, which starts.   Then the camera focuses on these main garage contents: an older Jeep Wrangler, a well-kept futon, living amenities (cookware, fridge, toaster, etc), and shelves-upon-shelves of projects that vary in subject and stage.  The YOUNG MAN is grabbing his toothbrush and paste from the bathroom pantry just as the camera re-focuses on him.  He jumps in the shower, dutifully scrubbing his pits, shampooing his hair, and cleaning his butt crack with one hand while the other brushes.  The YOUNG MAN exits the shower with it still on.  He spits into the slop sink before turning the faucet off.  He dries himself off with a towel hanging near the sink.  He throws his clothes on just as quickly as his mess of hair is coifed.  The YOUNG MAN makes sure to lock the bedroom door, then hits the garage door opener above his desk. He hops into his Jeep, shifts into gear, and pulls out.

A BLack

We see black, what we hear is important.  The radio is turned on, and "Drex" can initially be hear.  We hear a CD case opened, and a CD inserted into the player.  Then, we hear "This American Life" - the one about love. 

Cut TO;

Long: YOUNG man in his jeep approaching traffic 

The YOUNG MAN approaches heavy traffic, and "This American Life" - the one about love - can be heard on the radio.  He pauses the CD just before he hits traffic, yelling loudly at first to overcome the winds and Jeep loudness.  He stops yelling after one short sentance, and the rest of the monologue is spent waiting for the on-ramp lights to un-bottleneck cars and let them on the highway.  The Jeep top is off, making background noise quite audible.

YOUNG MAN

(shifting in and out of first and second gear)

THIS IS NOT a love story.  Yes, I fell in and out of love over the course of my as-of-yet unbequeathed tale.  And just once, I got to experience something Noah-and-Ally like, without the happy ending. 

Flash: Noah and ally, then a red-anti-circle

YOUNG MAN

I'm beginning to think "happily ever after" is a figment of my cinemaphile imagination, but...maybe it isn't.  Personally, I have genuine hope for the latter.  And if that is the case, I've theorized that there are only three (YOUNG MAN holds up three the German way) traits the heterosexual, progressive-minded, modern male needs to look for in order to find a more perfect union, his (pause to think) Jack and Sally.  (YOUNG MAN lifts up index finger off steering wheel, and gets cut-off while he is speaking)  On...SON OF A...

We see that the person who cuts the YOUNG MAN off is an oriental woman who can barely see over the steering wheel.

YOUNG MAN

What a fink!


  Chemistry Sub-category A., Kissing.  I.  The important role of the first kiss, though ruined by cinema over many decades (->Shot, MONTAGE: FILMS RUINING FIRST KISS<-), really does say a lot about how things are going to proceed in that department.  If the first kiss is bad, ALWAYS try again.  Maybe...it was awkward for a reason.  Maybe you fell off a bike, or a STOOP!,  while heading in for that smoochity-smooch.  Maybe you just missed her lips completely and assaulted her upper cheek bone.  Regardless of the acknowledged error, TRY AGAIN.  If THAT'S nauseating, or just plain as non-crunchy peanut butter, go home.  I always stop calling women of interest after the first horrendous make-out session, because let's face it - there are different genres of kissers on this beautiful planet of ours, and a tongue in the wrong place at the wrong time or a low tongue to lip-locking ratio means MOVE ON sailor.  I've been contemplating a new approach, though.  I've got this...theory.  The next awful, no good, very bad smoocher I go mouth-to-mouth with WILL hear about it.  I'm going to say to her, "Your tongue is dancing around my throat like a heart-attack."  Ok, I haven't QUITE worked out the verbiage yet.  I might get punched in the face and never hear from her again, but it's a win-win situation - unless there is tooth loss involved.  (<-Parenthetical, YOUNG MAN lifts up three fingers, like the Germans do, off steering wheel->)  THREE.  Make absolutely- fucking-sure the woman you fall in love with pleases herself.  Try slipping THAT one into casual dating conversation:  "Oh, and by the way do you masturbate?".  If she doesn't diddle, dilly-dally your way out of there.  Women that don't play fiddle sticks can't even please themselves, you think you can bring them to a new sexual level?  (<-Parenthetical, YOUNG MAN shrugs->)  Sometimes, yes.  Example scenario:  I once knew a Catholic girl, woman, who didn't masturbate because she thought all her dead relatives were watching her.  REALLY.  Long story short, she eventually got engaged, and after doing so, her fiance told her it was time to spice up things up in the sack starting with more jobs of the blow kind.  (<-Parenthetical, YOUNG MAN makes blow job motion with his tongue and cheeck->)  Presumably, she didn't like going down on him because all her dead relatives were cheering her on, but maybe that's just my imagination going into over-drive.  I'll skip the logistics here, but a bowl of Pop Rocks now resides next to their bed.
 

The Jeep nears the on-ramp traffic lights.  The YOUNG MAN takes notice, and concludes his ramble.

YOUNG MAN

Anyways, fuck love stories.  This is a story about me.

The YOUNG MAN shows his disdain for on-ramp traffic lights and blows through them.  He has a smirk on his face.

Est. Shot - Steady cam

A Jeep pulls into a corporate manufacturing parking lot.  The YOUNG MAN steps out of the car, simultaneously putting on his blue, electrostatic work-smock and grabbing his 64oz. iced coffee and vanilla long john.  He shoves the doughnut quickly down this throat while walking towards the main entrance.  In a very exaggerated, Mission Impossible-style motion, he pulls out his I.D. badge from a clip-on pulley, swipes the card, then lets the badge retreat to his side. He enters quickly, immediately looking at the clock showing 8:15 A.M., which the camera focuses on.  The YOUNG MAN heads toward his desk, passing rows of half glass-walled cubicles.  He bumps into one of his bosses, having a conversation with him as they approach and retreat from each other.

Dan (Boss 1)

Frank, are you just getting here?!

YOUNG MAN (FRANK)

Nope, just ran out to the Big Red and grabbed my coffee.

Frank shakes his coffee cup.  His eyes roll as he walks away. When he arrives at his desk, he stops momentarily to set his coffee down and wake his computer up.  This starts the Credits.  Frank then heads for the bathroom.

(CUE MUSIC-Fall Out Boy, "Honorable Mention")


FRANK walks to the bathroom as the camera follows him from a relatively higher angle, showing the spectacle which is the production floor of a manufacturing plant.  Find way to use cubicles as credits.  He covers territory from cubicles to machine shops in an intricate, memorized path.  FRANK interacts with the younger employees he passes by fist "bumping" them.  He receives some "Morning, Buttercup" hello's on his journey.  He greets a few people, though the music makes the words only slightly audible.  FRANK enters the bathroom.

FRANK opens the door and enters the stall.  Then he locks it.

FRANK pulls out a small, over-door hanger for his smock.

CLOSE UP: Stall door crack

FRANK makes sure to cover the large crack in between the stall door and wall by taking off his smock and placing it on the hanger.

FRANK

I like my privacy.

FRANK starts to pepper the seat with toilet paper.  This line is mumbled, since people can be heard coming in and out of the bathroom.

FRANK

(mumbling)

You would think someone played a game of swords in here!

Est. Shot - Frank on toilet

This is the first time that the camera really focuses on the physical details of FRANK.  The camera starts at the ground, noticing his DC slippers, then argyle socks, then grease stained pants (which are pulled up).  His neck beard and Zac Efron-esque hair are slightly longer than they should be for the corporate world, but he doesn't seem to mind.  He is wearing a bright orange Volcom polo.  FRANK attempts to sit in a relaxed position.

FRANK

I'm not really sure when this all started.

Where exactly does the simple title get shown? Into the Wild-ish?  Something more dangerous?

FRANK

I guess it was during high school.

FRANK (NARRATION)

Most of my brilliant creative acts back then were based on the simple fact that public school blessed anyone of above-average intelligence with ample free time.

C Int. typing Classroom - Freshman year

FRANK can be seen creating entire worlds in MS Paint, literally.  All the computers are vintage, white, boxes running Windows '98.  Everyone else can be seen typing away with Mario running across their screens, holding letters of the alphabet.

Freshman year, Typing Class.  I dedicated thirty of the fifty minute periods to creating a series of portraits in M-S Paint entitled, "The Life and Death of a Snowman", no doubt Bill Watterson inspired.

Just a minute.  Look at this.

FRANK

My mom only knew one style - it truly was bowl cut or no cut.  And it was rare for me to choose the 'Super Cut', because lets face it, I wanted to keep the whole-ness of my ears. Reference the character I forget who has cut ear?

A STORY FRANK walks out.

FRANK (NARRATION)

If I finished a lesson early, there were only so many time-killing possibilities.  Describe what others did - carve names in desk, bother the attractive female teacher, etc? See, typing was a morning class.  Going to the lunchroom to feed my pubescent appetite a second time wasn't an option, so really, what else was I supposed to do with my time?

C Int. Architecture classroom - sophomore year

Frank (Narration)

(heavy sarcasm regarding double-hung windows)


Show young frank and his noteboooks? Show buildings by architects?

As a kid, I had wanted to be an architect.  I filled many 5th grade notebooks with accurately dimensioned floor-plans for my future businesses and mansions.  And Chicago was a great place to be an aspiring architect - Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, George Maher - all of these men shaped the surroundings we traveled day in and day out.  Maybe it was the beginning of a pre-college weed out process, but years of my life were wasted on digitally drawing the intricate subtleties that exist in the double-hung window and it's less exhilirating cousins. Show other windows?

Montage: Frank's autocad drawings (cars, santa, etc)

Focus on class.  AutoCAD is displayed on some desktops, but the majority happen to have up EBAY and other car forums - it's a suburban high school thing.  Students are not working diligently.  FRANK raises his hand.

FRANK

Can I go to the bathroom?

teacher

(sternly, but half-zombie like)

If you are finished with your work, yes.

(CUE MUSIC-Spitalfield, "Am I Ready?")

FRANK nods, clicks print on his computer desktop - which depicts an EBAY window with a generic Camaro parts auction - then heads to the printers, located next to the exit door.  He folds the printed document up and places it in his pocket. As he does this, FRANK notices large 2' x 3' plotting paper stacked next to the printer.  He looks up to make sure no one is looking, grabs exactly two sheets, and heads for the door. 

c int. barltett high school main stairwell

FRANK can be seen climbing the main stairway to the very top third-floor.  Class is in session, the halls are empty.  He makes a basic paper airplane with the first sheet, then failingly attempts to fly it.  The dialogue starts in during his second attempt with a more aerodynamic 'fighter pilot' design.

FRANK (NARRATION)

I think it was like baby steps, really.  Nobody teaches you to play in the gray areas, you just get up and start walking one day.

B EXT. Maxwell street market - WEE HOURS

FRANK, in his final fifth year of college, is finishing the night at Maxwell Street Market with a group, getting the typical polishes and fries.  A semi-drunk conversation on life and graduation ensues as they walk toward the artsy fountain and head to the lighted, but vacant, UIC baseball field.

FRank (narration)

I met SHANKS during Auto Class my Senior Year of High School.  He had this very oddly-placed partiality of pink hair right near his widow's-peak.  Anyways, one day my younger, freshman sister, knocked on the entryway glass of the classroom to say,

frank's Sister

Hi!

Directly after, SHANKS spoke his first words to me:

FRANK

Consequently, he got punch-buggied.

When I first met Hollister, I noticed something about her right away.  She had...ambition. Figure out transition. 

One.  Ambition.  If all your girlfriend does is go to work, come home to Friends on D-V-D, and every weekend she 'just waents to dance'...paruse further.  Holly wasn't plethorally ambitious, but dear God...I could at least play with her!  I'm talking hobbically here (eyes roll).  For instance, if your main interests regard sliding on a board down a mountain, make sure she can quote 'Out Cold' in her sleep.  We may be cinematically taught that opposites attract, but the starched reality is that you can't be besties if you don't play together.

B EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - WEE HOURS

(CUE MUSIC-The Hush Sound, "Lighthouse")


Frank can be seen riding his Dyno VFR down a deserted weekday Michigan Avenue at 3 a.m.

FRANK (NARRATION)

Something happens in the wee hours,
like great notes colliding to form a haphazard chord that resonates in
to an unexpected orchestral tune,
one that surprises no one more than the fretless notes themselves,
who were doing little other than extending the night beyond the realm of the nine to five
because the sun doesn't always dictate the shape of the day.

Frank

I didn't write that, but it's so very poetically perfect.  These flawless spring nights in the city spring life back into me: my ninety-six Dyno, my thoughts, and me - cruising the streets.  Many people never get to experience Chicago in all its perfection - Michigan Avenue at three A.M. on a luke-warm weeknight.  Living in the city is a constant battle, but this almost makes up for it.  I'm constantly looking for an undiscovered Nighthawks-like diner around every turn, constantly extorting the boundaries of reality and film to make my night as interesting as an eighty's Scorcese character's.  When all else fails, I head to the lighthouse.

Going to school in the city was one of the best, and probably worst, ideas I ever had.  My roommate for most of college, Matty, brought up a good point - we both would have probably become drunkards like much of the frat population at farm schools. Yes, I loved to visit these schools and see the shackers departing for their own beds as I was leaving for the city, but to do that, and only that, for four to five years boggles my mind.  Those guys become THOSE guys and they end up being your boss.

Giardianerra: definition.  Chicago may be ludicrously, politically corrupt, have a sewer system that smells like chocolate poop, and hate all forms of transportation - but I know of no major city, other than Chicago, that readily offers giardianerra as a topping on foods.  If that isn't reason enough to brave the ugliness that is the UIC campus,

B EXT./int. Cook County hosptial - Wee hours

(CUE MUSIC-The Audition, "You've Made Us So Self Conscious)


Frank follows what seems like an all too typical pattern breaking into the old hospital with Alan and a few others.  Alan plays look-out while Frank jumps over the large blue and white wall semi-temporary wall surrounding the premises.  Frank gets over the wall and pushes the one access door open from the inside.  From there, the group quickly follows the exterior wall to the fire escape, and heads up to the window on the second flat.  A possibly dead security camera is focused on, then the small block of wood holding the vintage window open.  Alan holds the window open for everyone, and then goes in himself.  The group walks towards the elevators and looks around at the surroundings.  Shit is thrown everywhere, like everyone just got up and left one day.   One of the members of the group grabs some instruments and starts doing something funny with them.

CLOSE UP: Burn ward, 5th floor sign

FRANK (NARRATION)

Living in the dorms on the west side of campus my freshman year put us in the middle of the medical district.  Right next to the modern Stroger Hospital lurked the semi-abandoned Cook County Hospital, along with it's connected children's hospital and power plant.  The (architectural style) building was just sitting there vacant; its future in political debate, just waiting for drunk college kids to explore it.

B INt. UIC Tunnel System

Frank, Shanks, and group of others are shown in the tunnels.

FRANK

Besides having Cook County to the North, we had the UIC tunnel system across the street to the East.  While it did offer one of the most beautiful, unobstructed views of the city, all the late night exploring made it hard to get to class...most especially my eight to ten-thirty A.M. Introduction to Greek and Mediterranean Archeaology class.  This professor must have wanted me to fall asleep.  It was the perfect sleeping temperature, almost always dark, and the most comfortable position in those vintage seats was sleeping.  Ironically, out of all the classes I took in college, this was one of three which were attendance based.  

A INT. WOODWARD MPC ELECTRONICS BATHROOM/STALL

FRANK

I mean, so what, I missed a few classes.  Ok, I may have slept through my second midterm...I did sleep through it.  I studied, though, and that counts for something.  Maybe the real question we should be asking here is, meta-physically, universally, does it count for anything?  I guess that depends on if your an existentialist or not.  I'm not.  I'm not really a spiritualist either, I'm more of an activist, but not the protestist kind.  Why should I have let myself fail the course due to one up-too-late study session?!  To beat the system, you have to play the game.  And unfortunately, honesty is rarely the choice of choice when it comes to choosing excuses.  And that's a real problem with society.  I'm not a betting man, but as a friend to mathematics, I'd take odds against the truth situationally speaking.

Frank is shown knocking on the door of a sick dormitory friend.

Up until my last year in college, every apartment we had rented came with street-only parking.

B INT. Shanks' Saturn - evening

(CUE MUSIC-Fall Out Boy, "Chicago Is So Two Years Ago")


Shanks is seen driving around in his Saturn looking for parking in the Little Italy area.  He turns down the music on his IPod.

SHANKS

Entire wars have been waged for legal street parking on Taylor Street, with the weapons of choice being Super Target-purchased WMD's like neon-orange cones and lawn chairs. 

MONTAGE: show "saved" spots scenefrom shanks' vantage point

SHANKS

Even if you are talented enough to parallel bump your way into a legal spot...

LONG: SHow car trying to parallel park from shank's vantage point

Shanks

...you are never safe from the evil that is the Chicago "Street Cleaning" signs.  I don't care WHERE you park in the city - you could park on the FUCKING lake - but those signs will FIND a way to hunt you down and hang themselves on a God-Damned tree adjacent to your car.  Presumably, the city puts them up to keep the streets clean.  It could be mid-January and the Daley machine would still be posting "Street Cleaning" signs,  citing leaves on the street!  Legally, you're supposed to be given a few days notice to move the imposing car, but that's as much a rarity as rust-free first-gen F- body.  I'VE got a theory on these signs, though.  The Daley machine is actually comprised of clones of himself, payed for by taxpayers.  Those same clones refer to the actual mayor as King Daley and carry out his bidding...probably the ones that plowed over a single airfield in one night.  But you know what?  Any man that has that much power and says it aloud, shouts his manly yalp instead of hiding it like the other politicians, well...I can respect that.

Shanks is finally parked.  He erases the date on his temporary Zone-5 permit and changes the date.  The he places it on his dashboard with the numbers barely visible above the cowl line.

Int. Hawkeyes Downstairs - Later

A slightly different group of characters, but no typical none-the-less, are drinking and eating wings at one of the local bars. The waitress comes to the table.

SHANKS

Who's THIS gorgeous lady. 

WAITRESS

Oh, Shanks!  Who nees a refill?

MATTY

I'll take another Hamms, Ash.

ASH (WAITRESS)

Anybody else?!

PETER

(raises an empty Hamms can and hands to ASH)

Ditto. 

FRANK

(makes the face of agony)

Uhhh, I dunno. Fifty cent beers give me massive beer shits the next day.  I need to use the bathroom already. 

MATTY

You take massive shits regardless.

ROB

(staring intently at his empty Hamms can)

I wonder if Hamms exists anywhere else at this price, or even if it exists at all?  Maybe it's just a figment of my imagination.  Maybe this is my Heaven, and it's full of fifty cent beer. 

ERIC

The wings are supposed to aid in making the poop's viscosity syrupy and making sure it comes out non-geiser like.

ROB

Why wouldn't I want free beer in Heaven, though?  Is it because I've been conditioned to think the taste of a cold brew after a long day is so much more satisfying than after doing nothing at all?  I don't CONSCIOUSLY think I think that way, but...

ASH

ROB!

ROB

I'll take another.

SHANKS

The wings are going to give him the runs, not the Hamms.

ROB

How do you even become a distributor of Hamms?  This is the only place I've ever seen it sold.  And I mean ONLY. 

PETER

(making a bad-smell gesture)

ERIC already has gas from the wings...I can smell him.  Jesus, that gets old.

ROB

I think I'd like to become a Hamms  distributor.  I bet there's good business in that.

ERIC

(farting motioning and laughing)


SHANKS

(making a salty face)

I can only begin to fathom your ability to produce such distinguishable, grotesque, gastrointestinal, smells.  You are a true master of the art.

FRANK notices a beautiful girl walking by as he comes back from the bathroom.  She is wearing boots.  His jaw is practically on the floor.

FRANK

(grabbing SHANKS' head and turning it for him)

SHANKS, check it out.  Boot season!

SHANKS

(in unison with FRANK)

Boot season!

PETER

It's not boot season!

SHANKS

It's always boot season!

FRANK (O.S)

The whole group is having an animated conversation in slow-motion.  Everything is muted but FRANK (O.S.).

I was half in love with her by the time I sat down. That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty...you fall half in love with them, and you never know where the hell you are.

CUT TO:

A INT. WOODWARD MPC ELECTRONICS BATHROOM/STALL

FRANK

I didn't write that, but let's go with it.  Two, Chemistry, which we'll divide into two, equally important, sub-categories:  A.  Kissing, and B.  Copulation.  Example scenario:

BACK to hawkeyes

You're in a room with this girl for the first time.  Your eyes meet serendipitously, and Boots is definitely returning the elevator eyes you've been shot-gunning at her.  If the FIRST thing that enters your mind is, "Damn, I've got to be inside this person.", and just being in the same vicinity with her makes it physically impossible to ignore the urge to make babies - we've got a winner.  These sensations should not be confused with any sexual gestation? you've encountered when pist-drunk on the social scene. 

montage of imagined dating this girl

FRANK (O.S.)

And should you end up dating, this is a girl whom - no matter how much time has passed, or who you're intimate with now - phereomones will always get the best of you.   Without this, lasting love is a near impossibility. 



Chemistry Sub-category A., Kissing.  I.  The important role of the first kiss, though ruined by cinema over many decades (->Shot, MONTAGE: FILMS RUINING FIRST KISS<-), really does say a lot about how things are going to proceed in that department.  If the first kiss is bad, ALWAYS try again.  Maybe...it was awkward for a reason.  Maybe you fell off a bike, or a STOOP!,  while heading in for that smoochity-smooch.  Maybe you just missed her lips completely and assaulted her upper cheek bone.  Regardless of the acknowledged error, TRY AGAIN.  If THAT'S nauseating, or just plain as non-crunchy peanut butter, go home.  I always stop calling women of interest after the first horrendous make-out session, because let's face it - there are different genres of kissers on this beautiful planet of ours, and a tongue in the wrong place at the wrong time or a low tongue to lip-locking ratio means MOVE ON sailor.  I've been contemplating a new approach, though.  I've got this...theory.  The next awful, no good, very bad smoocher I go mouth-to-mouth with WILL hear about it.  I'm going to say to her, "Your tongue is dancing around my throat like a heart-attack."  Ok, I haven't QUITE worked out the verbiage yet.  I might get punched in the face and never hear from her again, but it's a win-win situation - unless there is tooth loss involved.

  INT. Hawkeyes Downstairs - CHeers scene

Int. Mr. greeks - wee hours

The very drunken boys have another round of drunken conversation at yet another of Little Italy's finest eateries.  Matty is supremely drunk.  Conversation is had while waiting in line, and then sitting at table.

ROB

Do you kids remember Zorbas?

Most of the drunk group yells, "Opa!" as camera pans.

Long: Pan over to where zorbas used to be through windows

Rob

That place was PHENOMENAL.  What was the waitress' name that always ended up waiting on us?  She had to be happiest chain-smoker I ever met.

SHANKS

I miss their breakfast.  Mary Anne's is a close second. 

SHANKS elbows FRANK tauntingly.

Peter

Don't get me started.

FRANK

I went, like, three years without ever having a Mr. Greek's Gyro because of Zorba's.  Breakfast sits much better in your stomach at four A.M.

SHANKS

There's breakfast on the menu.

MATTY

Yea, but the Mexican's behind the counter won't make it for you unless the owner is in.

ERIC

Pansies.

This seudo conversation is taking place at the same time as the one above.  Two ASSHOLES can be faintly heard saying something about

FRANK has his arms crossed with his hands on his knees, head on top of his arms.  A vibrating phone in his pants, the light showing through the fabric, wakes him up. 

FRANK

Hey DAN (BOSS), what's up?

DAN

Where are you?

FRANK

(preparing himself to lie)

I'm in building seven over in my lab.  We're having a few issues, so they'll probably need me for the next couple days.  What's up?

High school FRANK

And that's how Corporate America went.  I was a quick kid, keeping busy without doing busy work was relatively hard.  ou know, even if I wanted to be quick - I don't think I could be.  So, you learn to slow yourself down.  What did everyone else do?

A INT. WOODWARD MPC ELECTRONICS BATHROOM/STALL

FRANK

Part one of our story ends here.  How do people do this all their lives?  It might as well be a scene straight from Walden.  There's got to be more to existence, existing, than a monotonous nine to five, scratch that...an eight to five, WITH a mandatory hour-long lunch!  

(Frank looks at time on watch)

It's nine-thirty A.M. on a Monday morning.  I'm still hung-over from that bludgening bottle of red, and trying to NAP in a bathroom stall.  HEY, what the FUCK are you doing with YOUR life?

A loud group of farts can be heard echoing from the stall next to FRANK.

Honors society

I don't remember the name of the principal who fucked me, but in that moment, high school went from everything to nothing. It never occurred to me that the system was flawed; I was an A student my entire life, littered with a few B's. Varsity Sports. Food drives. But I was quiet, and this was the most detrimental thing. My father always told me to stick your head down and work hard, and I did. I was never able to fully believe that again.

I also remember the district being poorly managed, and this was the year it was first felt - an affluent suburb removing programs it couldn't afford to pay for because Some bitch was making a million dollars and stealing from the taxpayers. The teacher's had lost some of their gusto, knowing full well they were getting canned.

The culmination of this and my non-acceptance into the National Honors Society led me to roam the hallways more often in my last semester. Probably more-so than what was expcected, at least.

SLeep Habits

I've had a habit of falling asleep in the oddest of places all my life. Those who can't sleep say I'm lucky, those who can don't understand. See, I tended to wear myself down with my interests, and high school hockey took up 5 nights of my week for 5 months. The 3 weekdays included practice which ended at midnight, and the rink was 30 minutes away. Giving 17 year olds a car, telling them to drive somewhere together, and expecting them to return on time...well, that's laughable. It's laughable now! We'd spend time collecting quarters and buying as many 5-piece nuggets we could at Wendy's (open late!), fucking around in the parking lot until we were done woofing down our corn-based chicken.

Anways, on account of this, I was consistenly exhuasted for 4 days of the 5-day school week. I'd be woken up at the crack of dawn for breakfasts's I can't remember. The only thing which would wake me up, at least momentarily, was a shower. Getting me in the shower, though, was another case entirely.

I'd lay my fresh towel down on teh bathroom floor (my parents were extremely neat, it was probably cleaner than my bed), turn the shower on, and fall asleep, rear to the sky. If I had been in there about 10 minutes, I'd get a loud yell or hard-fisted knock at the door. "Frank!". They knew.

When I would finally arrive at school, when the wheather was warm, I'd sleep in the backseat of my camaro. I couldn't just ditch school, everybody knew the car, but I could at least park it and get a nice 1-2 period nap. Or at least I thought. The car sat sow low the rear seats had a drivetrain hump separating them. In 1980, so far as I know, pony cars weren't equipped with seats that adjusted, so the backseat was my only uncomfortable option, being 6'3 and all.

When it was too cold to sleep in the Camaro, I'd venture to one of the outlying bathrooms and find the Handicapped stall. There I proceeded to tee-pee the entire area and make a nice, antiseptic surface area for me to casually nap. Public toilet's don't have backs on them, at least they didn't on my school, so finding the correct angle to lean back on was tough, as the 1mm single-ply didn't provide much cushion against the metal piping.

Years later, I'd come to backthrooms in corporate America. If you think the shit (pardon) that goes on in high school bathrooms is atrocious, than you're in for a suprise.

CUT TO SCENE WHICH EXISTS ALREADY 

Real Life

Movies never pose the realistic scenes of relationships; they never catch the post-sex orange juice chugging, naked dinners spent standing up over the sink. Do we fear doing the dishes? They never catch the morning after sex marathong whimsies of finding remnants on the kitchen table, and the 8-year old boy who can take anything and turn it into a king arthur sword and make stabs with the dildo in the window, not caring if the neighbors should see the (word for penis?) battle going on from outside.

I like it when Actors get up on stage after winning the oscars and they are real people.

Entertainment

The astro van was equipped with a vhs player and a flip down flat screen; this was considered state of the art for moving vehicle entertaiment in its day, but I was relegated to renting VHS tapes from the library that consited of old sinstra war movies and black/whites wiht actors like Paul Newman and Humphrey Bogart - this was actually right up my alley. The VHS player was not light on the car battery - if I didn't have enough gas to keep the car running (because I couldn't afford it), I'd jumpstart the car in the morning with the generator and an extension cord cut and used as DC power.

You can only read so many books in a day - I frequently read through Harry potter book in a couple sittings.Somtimes, even in teh middel of nowhere, you need to let your mind relax.

Deadlines

When I was 21, I told myself by the time I was 25 I would be one of the top 25 entreprenures under the age of 25. When I was 25, I told myself I'd travel by the time I was 30. And I mean really travel - my time in the bush didn't count.

Garages

When I moved to Denver, I had rented a garage over the phone to store the extra car I towed out. I also aimed to sleep in it, knowing it didn't have a bathroom or shower like the last one. The garage turned out to be in a shady neighborhood of denver and wasn't located off the beaten path, so I slept in the jeep for 2 weeks until I could afford to rent another garage in better area. I got a 24 hour fitness gym membership, and I showered there and "lightly" worked out everyday. Sometimes I swam. Anyways, becuase the floor of the jeep was metal and even though I bunched up blankets on top of the fuel filler door I built I got a huge black bruise on lower back. After two weeks I rented a garage for 3 months in wash park, and the entrance was off the beatan path, but I couldn't afford more sleeping gear after paying rent so I slept in my jeep again for 2 more weeks but at least felt safer than sleeping in random parking lots in front of hotels.

I think only one time some guys tried to break into the jeep, when I had the extension cord ran to a hotel power breaker, but I can't tell if that was just a bad dream or actual fuck heads.

It was cold in March/ april anyways, but d


SENIOR PRANK

I wasn't cool enough to be a part of the standard senior prank. I'm not even sure I remember what it was. As the course of my life has shown, when in doubt, streak.

Being that I had what they called early dismisall as a Senior, I left school 2 periods early every day. That was almost 2 hours ahead of most people.

Naturally, I used this privelege for evil. The high school had a special program called "The academy". All of the classes were advanced placement, and they decided to not only make it known there were smart kids behind the doors, but the architects though big steel doors hiding their braced faces would make them cooler or protect them. It was awful. Oh, and all the classrooms had entirely windowed walls on the outside, being setup like a square - you could have paid people to walk buy and make fun of them.

Taking advantage of the floor plan, I stepped from friends older boxy cherokee wearing bauer shower sandals, a hockey cup, and scratched ski goggles. I ran once around the classrooms, then up the stairs, peeking through the glass hole to see if anyone had come after me.

Only one asian teacher had, and he quickly dismissed me, and I jolted down the stairs and out to the car for a quick getaway.

Nobody believes me.

FREE BREAKFAST

I was unemployed, living in a van, and traveling the world - at least that's how I felt. Making $350 dollars a week and trying to manage that money between food, gas, and building supplies was extremely difficult; there were occasional bouts of money transfer in the form of $50 for food gifted to me by my parents. I might have died, otherwise.

There was often a lot of waiting period between payments - sometimes weekends - where I didn't get paid because the state of Illinois went on holiday (for no apparent reason) and I was left with $3.00 to my name. I learned to improvise quickly. Ramend and Jumex became my meals, but that wasn't sustainable. So, I setup a system for home-cooked meals, or at least as close as I could get - hotel food laundering.

By day, I'd park the van, shades down, in front of a hotel, sleeping and using free-wifi. I'd use the public bathrooms by night, always cleaning up and taking my "computer bag" in with me like I was staying there. Then, in the mornign, I'd walk in like I had just gone for a run (at least to the hotels that had the kitchen/eating area on the way past the front desk). Always saying good morning and greeting them, never returning to teh same place wearing the same clothes two days in a row. The Holiday Inn Express became my favorite breakfast; and there was a free newspaper to boot! And not just the local bullshit news, the new york times!

The smaller joints all had one thing in common - hard-boiled eggs and white bread. Shitty bread never went down so fast.

PROJECTS (WIP)

I received a phone call one summer's afternoon in two-thousand and eight from a friend eating at Chipoltle; I just read something on the back of my drink, and it reminded me of you. What he then read to me was the quotation above [in bold], and I couldn't have said it better myself! My projects are plentiful, costly, and broader than the scope of my lifetime. The never-ending list of interests comes from my quest to conquer the world in its entirety [or die trying, as the saying goes]; time rarely seems to be on my side, and I always find myself chasing daylight. I live by Ms. Frizzle's mantra, Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!, and find greatness in failure - I hope you can too.

I've found that my niche lies not just in bits and bytes, but rather somewhere in between, or as a combination of, both the digital and physical worlds. My belief in open access to information resonates deeply, and this is why I choose to share my world with you.

Enjoy exploring. It's a magical world.

Walkden RANCh (WIP)

I visited Colorado for the first time in April of two-thousand and eight on my last college spring break trip. It was then that I realized people are capable of choosing multiple places to call home over the course of their lifetime. Several months later, while living and working in Chicago, a friend and I decided to purchase five acres in San Luis Valley...on a whim [and off of Craiglist, none-the-less]. I would come to describe this whim as Manifest Destiny, even if half-joking.

My sister and I took a miserable there-and-back trip over that same Christmas holiday. We managed to sign the deed, get it notarized by the county, and make it back to Chicago in less than forty-eight hours. Colorado, officially, became the second place I got to call home.

A few months after the purchase, I was laid off from my first real-world engineering job. Not long after, I set out on what would become a three month journey of self-discovery [and grifting, which is where the title of this blog comes from!]. I had satellite radio, an Astro van full of power tools, and a map of the property...just the necessities :) I arrived in the San Luis Valley during the scorching heat of August, threw on cowboy boots once purchased for a sorority barn dance, and started to dig.

[design] Over the years, I've gotten better at planning, but I am still heavily lacking in this area. <- This is OK, though; I've learned to cope with thinking on-the-fly! As you'll see from the designs [or lack thereof], my point is proved. My mind tends to wander when I start putting things on paper, and I usually finalize the problem-at-hand in my head, leaving only traces of analytics on paper. I've gotten pretty good at deciphering scribbles.

I've wanted to build a house my entire life, and can recall drawing mansions on long road trips as far back as third grade.

Since then, my perceptions on what a house should be have changed [at least the one I would build with my bare hands]. The concept of Walden Ranch started simply: it had to be off-the-grid and something I could build in blocks, without the help of anyone else. Read: no cement foundation, a single story, and no fancy woodwork.

dedications (WIP)

"To Her, Hand in had we come, Christopher Robin and I, To lay this book in your lap. Say you're surprised? Say you like it? Say it's just you wanted? Because it's yours - because we love you."

My favorite layer of a book is the dedication; whether it be a mysterious shout-out or an elaborate, loving thank-you, I find comfort, inspiration, and happiness in them. People always ask, Do you have a favorite?. To answer, my [rather odd] most beloved happens to be printed on the interior cover of a fictional book, in a fictional movie, where all the characters are just...fictional. It reads, very simply, To J.L.W. This seemingly effortless statement fused with the dramatic pause in which it is read affected me enough to inspire a twelve-hundred mile move [more on that, later].

Throughout my life I've periodically chronicled thoughts and feelings which were expressive of the moment; some defining, some not. This is my attempt to polish and bring to fruition the reflections placed on the back shelves of my mind, in hopes that they'll do for you what dedications do for me. Some of what I lay before you may seem rough around the edges, and that's ok; following the mantra of the Slow-Web Movement - making sure the prose doesn't lack poise or good taste - takes time.

Carpal Tunnel

I gave myself god damned carptel tunnel because I decided it would be ok to side a cabin in 4 days by myself by hand. Fuck.

<h2>banks</h2>
I read an article about massachcuses, or rhode island, or one of those early states, removing all of the money in a mans bank account on a whim, well sort of. He was in delibrartion and because there was a loophole they knew they could get away with they did it. To esercise power. Well, now I take out all my money and I put it in a safe in the wall of my cabin. This way it looks like my assets are nothing. Fuckers.

Cheers (WIP)

For the same reason book dedications distract me from my existential nihilism with a twist (with hope the place described in "Where the Sidewalk Ends" exist), I love the emotions a simple salutation can invoke in a group - a joyous gravitas. I've taken it upon myself to collect them.

Hosptical scavening

When we would explore the abandoned hospitals, we found the weirdest shit there. I took home doctors manuals and patients records, just to have. My roommate took speakers he found. We were poor freshmen.

AUDIO SNIPPETS

- In third grade I only had one enemy; his name was Danny Audette, and he wrote on my desk.

<h2>[opening 1]</h2>
The story of my life, as I always envisioned telling it, starts here - not quite the middle, but far enough down the line that if I were in labor we'd be panicking and running over bicycles like in the Henry Fonda/Lucille ball version of Yours, Mine, and Ours. Memoirs are for pussies - biographical twists are in. It's not the script.


<h2>[opening 2]</h2>

I've got this issue with cutting things. Not like my wrists or other people or anything - Jesus - it's more of a minimilast thing. I think I got it from growing up cluttered. This one time I tried to restore a 1979 KZ750 my friend practically gave to me for $400, but I ended up slicing and dicing with a grinder I got from home depot and before you know it, the bike had no neck and I decided it would be too costly to continue. Just like that. Then I took the bike with me when I moved and didn't have a garage in the new place so I put it in the basement and oil leaked all over the floor and when I moved from there I put it outside for the trash pickers.

VISUAL SNIPPETS

- There is a place where the sidewalk ends. White chalk arrows and all.

I can accept I am but a [bag of meat, sitting on a rock in outer space](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/religion), and that there is [probably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism) _nothing_ to this thing but that which we have created for ourselves. But, I _do_ consciously hope there is some semblance of magic in existance which we dinky humans are not privy to understanding - something other than [turtle upon turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down), of course.

In using the above as a foundation, I have _never_ found my morals to be compromised; logic, [gut](http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669), and feelings have helped structure these more clearly than any religion could have. If I had to break this down into a mission statement:

```
I would rather live fully, bound by no physical patriotisms, with a moral code imposed on my own terms - taken subjectively from all religions, using my personal feelings and thoughts as a guide - than wager with Pascal about the after-life.
```

<h2>[tangent]</h2>
The effect Aaaron Swartz's suicide **\[and its aftermath\]** had on me was [more tremendous](http://discountgeni.us/2013/01/13/why-am-i-so-upset-about-aaron-swartzs-suicide/) than I anticipated. I have been _attempting_ to write this piece for many months, saving links and writing snippets as my thoughts gathered. _Then_ the precipice of the reactions came to be - my girlfriend and I watched _two_ very important people in Aaron's life [give their eulogies](http://www.livestream.com/democracynow/share?clipId=pla_f83c80fe-0fc0-474c-9936-efe8659466f6).

I have always felt `vigorously` different in regards to the paths I chose, but the word [marvelous](http://danwin.com/2013/01/edward-tufte-aaron-swartz-marvelously-different/) never seemed appropriate **\[I will always be my toughest critic\]**. My intentions here lie with making the purpose behind those chosen paths known, while also introducing myself into an area I am not entirely comfortable with entering.

I consider the writings bequeated to us by the founding fathers of this country the culmination of knowledge and ethics regarding political institutions _up to to that point_.

One only has to look at how an extremist thinks and lives - political or religious - to gain insight as to why they should be consumed with a salt-shaker in hand. The problem which exists, though - _irrational, fear-mongering debochery_ - was not only foreseen, but self-documenting:

```
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes.

**Prudence, indeed**. But what of it?

_Discretion_, at least definitively, is open to interpretation.

All systems implemented by man are _fallible_. Just as once-inky text has faded from the parchments we _held_ so high, passing of time has led to the systematic degredation of _our_ rights through _graft_ and _greed_ ...discretions... and men who never understood anything but `gaslighting` and only had dreams of [phooey](http://www.amazon.com/Like-You-Sandol-Stoddard-Warburg/dp/0395071763).

Nearly the [entirety](http://jacquesmattheij.com/life-as-a-service) of your influences are derived from the location in which you were born. Religious zealots are amazingly good at ignoring this fact.

Growing up here meant growing up cowboy; we've all got an inkling of John Wayne in us. It is noticeable when comparing myself to _every_ European I have _ever_ encountered: I find myself to be more direct, but less frigid. Casual is as casual does. More wasteful. More impermeable. 

I understand stereotypes of Americans aren't far off, physically, from much of the population - sneakers, jeans, and an XL t-shirt, but the real beauty of living here is that we are all vastly, distinctly, different. Of course we can't come to an agreement on anything. **But that's the point of this place.** It's a safe haven for the world's different. The very principles we founded ourselves upon _should_ have made this apparent, but the words inscribed in the stanzas on our Lady of Liberty somehow went out of fashion.

<h2>[the bill of rights]</h2>

Most of the rights gauranteed to the citizens of this country have been stricken from us in times of fear; it is understandably human nature to do so, `but it does not mean the actions taken steered us correctly on course`. As I see it, **_three_ of _ten_** rights remain; I hope the failing public school systems have got their textbooks up-to-date. Congress has become an incorrect representation of the people, and will continue to be so until the entity not only acknowledges it is bought and sold by lobbyists **\[and corporations paying for those very lobbyists\]**, but also finds itself removing the draperies used to shield its processes. _Seven_ rights, removed:

<h2>[conclusions]</h2>

The doctrine I have decided appropriate almost seems in some respects like thoughts a young _Howard Roarke_ would have.

1. Ingore man-made obstacles and man-made systems. 

At the root of every parking ticket or spike in hourly parking rate in a city is fiscal mismangaement. At the root of fiscal mismanagement is laziness (and possibly corruption). As I've said before, jobs for people is not a subsitute

I too, have dreams; many of them cooincide with Aaron's, as it turns out. `Maybe we're all a litte bit more alike than stereotypes typically convey`.

Violence and I have never had a true relationship, and my thoughts on it are best described by a post-911 John Stewart:

`[We live in] a country that allows open satire, [which is] why I grieve...but do not despair. They live in chaos, and chaos can't be sustained. Chaos is too easy and too unsatisfying.`

There is a line which must be drawn in the sand. On one side, modern revolution that comes with violence and death. On the side I stand, non-violence exixt - a real use for technology and the people who know how to use it.

I am offering a download up a download of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech, which is under copyright. It is not an ideal situation **\[when is it ever?\]**: the file is _not_ hosted on a physical server I own, as I moved to `the cloud` via Amazon Web Services a while ago, and therefor exists in multiple places across their hardware. I fully understand the implications this could hold, though I doubt anyone of stature reads this :)

<h2>[notes]</h2>
Taxes. 

Linda,

I knew you were a twit the moment you assumed the microwave was melted. Any logical-minded, non-twit would have simply pulled the plastic wrap off to reveal a beautiful facade (it took me all of 2 seconds to realize this was the issue).

Let's get this straight: I'm not paying any of these so-called "extra damages" you speak of; had you done proper due diligence before we moved in, you would have noticed a majority of these issues in existence already. If you decide to come after me for more money, I'll have the house condemned by the city.

Frankly (see what I did there), the relationship which existed between us during our stay was that of a use-use kind - we ignored the wiring that wasn't up to code, the water pressure that didn't exist, the ruining of my mattress when the shower pipes burst, etc., all trade-offs for cheaper rent.

In regards to the list of so-called "damages" and our responsibility for them:

1) At no point in time did we ever pry any doors open. The door had holes in it from the beginning, and any damage you see is a result of it not closing properly.

2) The toilet in the basement became stained from lack of use. This is because the bathroom was disgusting from the moment we moved in, so we used it as little as possible.

3) The light in the shower was pulled off the wall when we moved in.

4) The carpet in the bedroom was mostly covered by a bed the entire duration of our stay; its an impossibility for it to be "completely ruined". But if by ruined, you really mean "bug covered", than I believe this to be your problem...the windows lack screens!

5) We noticed many of the floor boards were overly worn when we moved in. Wood floors do become worn over time - it's called general wear and tear, and that's the owner's responsibility. Sorry for walking.

6) The blinds the former resident (Joaquin) purchased when he left to replace the broken blinds were not the proper size.

7) At no point in time did we drill any holes or have any drilled. Direct TV was installed when we moved in - the place was wired up already. Pay attention.

In regards to the basement room, saying I "nicked" a water pipe makes no sense. The water pipes sit on top of the drywall of the ceiling. They sit so delicately, in fact, that slight pressure on the ceiling starts a water leak. I'll happily accept the $150 deduction from our $1200 deposit on that.

I'll be ignoring any responses from you, so no need for a rebuttal. Use some logic when coming to conclusions; ignorance and laziness are not excuses.

Thanks,

Frank
