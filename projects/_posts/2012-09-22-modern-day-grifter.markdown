<h2>[scene: woodward, mpc - summer 2008]</h2>
The story of my life, as I always envisioned telling it, starts here - not quite the middle but far enough down the road that if I were in labor we'd be panicking and running over bicycles like in the Henry Fonda/Lucille ball version of _Yours, Mine, and Ours_. Memoirs are for pussies - biographical twists are in.
