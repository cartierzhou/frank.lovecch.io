There is a McDonalds and Walgreens on nearly every corner in the city of Chicago. The real city, not that Michigan Avenue shit. McDonalds has a dollar menu, Walgreens is expensive. Subway, not nearly as concentrated as the former super-giants, has five dollar foot longs - but I don't ever recall paying just five dollars. Going into the health content of McDonalds food would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me">redundant</a>. If you want to get racial, a <a href="http://dadeindustries.com/frank_lovecchio/custom404page.php">ridiculous</a> percentage of minority women are overweight, and so are their children. This is not a coincidence. 

There was a time in my life where I ate fast food nearly everyday, and not by choice. Often I jetted from Chicago to the suburbs after class, and didn't have the sense to make sandwiches for the road (or I lacked the time to shop). My choice of restaurant was often Taco Bell, as they have a fresco menu, and I could order something without sauce. My weight never strayed, but we'll call that the benefit of having an over-active metabolism and living an active lifestyle. What I longed for was a cheap fast food restaurant that had things like sandwiches, cucumber salad, and pasta with oil; energy foods with low fat content which didn't make me feel terrible after eating.

Create a simple, culturally diverse, menu selection. Make it with healthy ingredients, using locally contracted bakers. Make it fast, and make it cheap. People will come.
