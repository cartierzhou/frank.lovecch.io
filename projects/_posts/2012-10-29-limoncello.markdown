I attended a Midwest wedding which took place just before all the punch-colored leaves had succeeded from their branches. A crispness had fallen upon Wisconsin it had not been privy to as of yet; as such, hot cider was served as the vows were read, tales of love regaled. The reception which followed resurrected memories of fictional grandeur displayed in _Father of the Bride_. `Just admiring the stature and prowess of the white, canvasy tent invoked happiness`, as sometimes places which hold joyous events do. My loved ones surrounded me over the course of dinner, and the air held `a light aromatic ambiance` which dusted my skin; I felt warm, a combination of the alcohol and inspiration **\[the _two_-piece jazz band probably had something to do with this as well\]**. I can't remember my thought process entirely, but instead recall a moment of introspection where a forgotten memory had reintroduced to my conscious, `a Hail Mary of the mind`.

`My Uncle Joe used to make limoconello`. Technically, he isn't _really_ my Uncle - just a relative on the Italian side of my family, where everyone is called something other than what they're supposed to be. Spending holidays at Honor and Joe's house was consistently one thing - full of boisterous life, love, and food...food! It didn't matter what the dishes of the day were, because it was always followed with desert sided with limoncello. `The funny thing about it is, I can't even remembr how it tasted`. 

And so I was inspired to continue down the path of tradition.

<h2>[on process]</h2>
As per my attention span, only a minute amount of research was had before the initial batch. 

1. I read that it took between _40_ to _80_ days for the alcohol to properly reflect the lemon zest taste. In certain instances, I read a minimum o of _ten_ days would be acceptable. I went with _7_.

1. Most pictures I found of the zests cut from the lemon were extremely thin, presumably because then the rhine **\[the white of the lemon underneath the skin\]** would be less likely to be cut off while zesting. I opted for larger zests, and de-rhined accordingly.

1. I gave the bottle a shake once a day. Live a little, ya know?

1. Serve warm. Nom nom.

1. Filter as necessary

<h2>[on lemons]</h2>
Ideally, I'd like to get lemons from Grand Junction.

<h2>[on bottles]</h2>
My original intentions were to bottle the limoncello in mason jars. Who doesn't love a good mason jar? Partly to stand out, partly for cost, partly for reuse, and partly because I hadn't searched for 'cork t-cap', as the site I was buying the bottles from only had plastic/cork combos, and frankly, I felt it to be too tacky.

Hello,

Somebody there was aware and thoughtful enough to remove the imposed character limit and added proper spacing to my labels. It didn't go unnoticed. "So shines a good deed in a weary world". Thanks :)

Frank
