I was at a friend's wedding, and I felt very inspired; there was something ambiantic that comes with being in a gigantic white tent, dressed to the _nines_, with all the people you love - all while a _two_ piece band brings life to the air. I can't remember my thought process entirely, but recall a moment of enlightment where a forgotten memory was pushed forth. 

`Uncle Joe used to make limconello`. Technically, he wasn't my uncle, but rather a relative on the Italian side of my family. Spending holidays with them was always full of the best food - mostaciolli with ridges, tiramusu so thick you wondered how it was conceived, an so on. And after dessert, or sometimes with it, he'd serve the adults limoncello. `The funny thing is, I can't remember how it tasted`. I must have tried it, and trying to recall whether or not I did only conjures up probable images of such.

I started to make limoncello upon return from the wedding.
