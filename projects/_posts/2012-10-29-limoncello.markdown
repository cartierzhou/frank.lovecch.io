A dual Italian-Scottish wedding I attended took place over colored, punchy leaves, friends of yore, and the only brisk weather that Midwestern Fall season had been privy to. The reception which followed invoked memories of the fictional grandeur displayed in _Father of the Bride_; `just admiring the stature of the white, canvasy tent invoked happiness`, as sometimes places which hold joyous events do. I had felt very inspired sitting inside there while dinner, dancing, and drinks occurred; my loved ones surrounded me, and `an ambiance held light and aromatic in the air` **\[the _two_-piece jazz band had something to do with this, no doubt\]**. I can't remember my thought process entirely, but recall a moment of reflection where a forgotten memory was shotgunned to the forefront of my mind. 

`My Uncle Joe used to make limoconello`. Technically, he wasn't _really_ my Uncle. Joe was just a relative on the Italian side of my family, where everyone is called something or than what they're supposed to be. Spending holidays at his house was consistently one thing; full of live, love, and food. Food! Mosticolli with ridges, canolis so fresh they should have been eaten the day after, and always, after dessert, limoncello. `The funny thing about it is, I can't even remember how it tasted`. 

And so I was inspired to continue down the path of tradition.

<h2>[on process]</h2>
As per my attention span, only a minute amount of research was had before the initial batch. 

1. I read that it took between _40_ to _80_ days for the alcohol to properly reflect the lemon zest taste. In certain instances, I read a minimum o of _ten_ days would be acceptable. I went with _7_.

1. Most pictures I found of the zests cut from the lemon were extremely thin, presumably because then the rhine **\[the white of the lemon underneath the skin\]** would be less likely to be cut off while zesting. I opted for larger zests, and de-rhined accordingly.

1. I gave the bottle a shake once a day. Live a little, ya know?

<h2>[on lemons]</h2>
Ideally, I'd like to get lemons from Grand Junction.

<h2>[on bottles]</h2>
My original intentions were to bottle the limoncello in mason jars. Who doesn't love a good mason jar? Partly to stand out, partly for cost, partly for reuse, and partly because I hadn't searched for 'cork t-cap', as the site I was buying the bottles from only had plastic/cork combos, and frankly, I felt it to be too tacky.
