In accordance with the spirit of this new year, I have been digging through the intranets for the best versions of 'Auld Lang Syne'. I managed to find the video versions of some favorites, along with a couple new ones that are super stellar. Some that I like aren't on YouTube but can be found on Itunes, so ya know, fuck that. Enjoy, kids.<br/>The Best of the Non-Instrumentals.<br/>Judy Garland. This girl did everything she sang justice.<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AJBFaAy9sA<br/>Bobby Darin. Yea, I've been listening to this one since I discovered Mob Hits in high school.<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_eDx7pq9fk<br/>Aretha Franklin & Billy Preston. Typically I dislike corrupting originals (because they tend to be awful), but they sure do take it to church here.<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U9zXXRiTVA&feature=related<br/>The Best of the Instrumentals<br/>Guy Lombardo & His Royal Canadiens. From what I read on Wikipedia, he popularized the tune in America starting with his radio broadcasts in the very late 20's. (apparently the jingle has been around for hundreds of years!)<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydT4wmR6KnQ<br/>Kenny G. 'Nuff said.<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn9_WXf35is&feature=related<br/>Honorable Mentions:<br/>Elvis. I sure hope there is a studio recorded version somewhere out there, as the crowd's singing ruins the rapture of his voice.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyjddB2RxZw<br/>Barenaked Ladies. YouTube disabled the audio of the original recording, but the live one keeps to the original beat with a few new lyrics.<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CZfwo75Xb0&feature=related<br/>Bing Crosby. I hear he does a mean rendition, though the intranets turned up nothing in playable form.
