In accordance with the spirit of this new year, I have been digging through the intranets for the best versions of 'Auld Lang Syne'. I managed to find the video versions of some favorites, along with a couple new ones that are super stellar. Some that I like aren't on YouTube but can be found on Itunes, so ya know, fuck that. Enjoy, kids.

The Best of the Non-Instrumentals.

Judy Garland. This girl did everything she sang justice.

Bobby Darin. Yea, I've been listening to this one since I discovered Mob Hits in high school.

Aretha Franklin & Billy Preston. Typically I dislike corrupting originals (because they tend to be awful), but they sure do take it to church here.

The Best of the Instrumentals

Guy Lombardo & His Royal Canadiens. From what I read on Wikipedia, he popularized the tune in America starting with his radio broadcasts in the very late 20's. (apparently the jingle has been around for hundreds of years!)

Kenny G. 'Nuff said.

Honorable Mentions:

Elvis. I sure hope there is a studio recorded version somewhere out there, as the crowd's singing ruins the rapture of his voice.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyjddB2RxZw

Barenaked Ladies. YouTube disabled the audio of the original recording, but the live one keeps to the original beat with a few new lyrics.

Bing Crosby. I hear he does a mean rendition, though the intranets turned up nothing in playable form.
