The setting: Johnny's Ice House, a hockey rink near UIC, more specifically the player's bench.<br/>The characters: Myself and a 'Pastor' we'll call Crazy Eyes, who is probably in his 60's.<br/>The plot: Myself is sitting on the bench minding my own business (hacking up a lung), when Crazy Eyes starts chit chatting me up.<br/>Crazy Eyes: 'What's your name? Do you go to school? Where do you work? How old are you?'<br/>He was pretty talkative for an old man, and since I've been trying to be less introverted, I answered his questions AND even asked him some. Here's the kicker:<br/>Frank: 'So, what do you do?'<br/>Crazy Eyes: 'I'm a Pastor'<br/>Frank: 'No SHIT!'"
