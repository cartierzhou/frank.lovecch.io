It has been 10 years since the Disney Channel aired their stupendous creation, "Brink!". I was in 8th grade at the time, and apparently, just discovering what 'soul skating' was all about (I think quotations may be an important part of this 'ode').<br/>As I was browsing the Wikipedia entry to refresh my memory of some of the characters names, I came upon the tagline of the movieâ€¦'It takes a champ to stay IN LINE'. wawaweewa. You can only expect such articulated puns from those Disney execs.<br/>While there's not much to be said about the intricate plot of ANY Disney Channel Original Movie (except for maybe 'The Paper Brigade' or 'Escape to Witch Mountain'), after all these years I can still throw a few quotations around at any social gathering: (although I usually get weird looks)<br/>'Nunya? Nunya business.' | 'Skate...better' | And obviously, 'soul skaters!' <br/>
And on that note, to fully close the 'Ode'... <br/>Beauty is truth, truth beauty, - that is all
