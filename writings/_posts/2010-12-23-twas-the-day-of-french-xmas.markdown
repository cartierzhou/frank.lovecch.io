Twas the day of French Christmas, and all through the house, creatures were stirring, and the damned dog was barking.  The wine was ordered, the t-shirts in - all while visions of hangovers danced in our heads.<br/>Jessica Bersani in her 'kerchief, and Sam TheException in his cap, had just settled in, for a long drinking night ahead.  When out in the parking lot, there arose such a clatter, Sam sprang from his chair, to see what was the matter.  Sam to the window, he flew like a flash! But what to his wondering eyes should appear?  A miniature Chevy Aveo, and 8 large green and red paper-chain reindeer. With a huge, handsome driver, so lively and quick, he knew in a moment, it must be...Frank LoVecchio.

Merry Christmas :)ï»¿<br/>It was too long to post as a status, so Facebook Notes, here we are.
