The district I attended through my senior year in high school kept a red folder full of writing samples that dated back to when I entered the district in 1991. One of my favorite pieces follows, an untitled sample from 3rd grade (including grammatical errors):<br/>I want a hamster. I will feed it and by a cage for it. If I have to I'll clean up after it, and name it.


If I get a white hamster I'll name it snowy. If I get a light brown one I will name it Soda Pop.

The cage will be a lot of money but I can afford it. I will buy a fridge and a glass boot that says 'Home Sweet Home'. It will also have a spinny wheel and tunnels.

The hamster food will be a big bag and money to. I will buy a couple bags of it. When I run out I'll go back to the store to get some.

If I have to clean up after it. I will buy a little shovel and put a garbage bag in my room. After I do that I will put some more brown stuff in the cage.

I want a hamster. I'm going to feed it, clean up after it, buy a cage for it and name it.
