Over the years, my writing has developed in different forms. My first journal was actually a running list of the women I had kissed, which I started while working at the pro shop my senior year in high school. I remember counting sixteen girls and thinking I was a man-slut. That list will not be posted here, but it currently resides in my Google Docs, updated only when a sudo-relationship goes awry - one of my very few superstitions. I typically like to publish most of my writing in the form of Facebook Notes, but I'm lowly and slowly trying to get away from this.
