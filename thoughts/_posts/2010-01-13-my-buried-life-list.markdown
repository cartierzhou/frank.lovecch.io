title: my buried-life list.
quote: Wnat do you want to do, before you die?
---

I feel a non-existant bond between myself and the fellows of [The Buried Life](http://a.com). Because the [Heisenburg Principle](http://a.com) applies to both particles and myself, I felt it necessary to measure the results of my life. My list is a little bit different than theirs; `I've left out having a family, falling in love, etc`, as those are defacto, standard. `This list is not about standard`, it's about strange, exciting, creation, adventure. _Some_ of the items _may_ seem trivial, but all reflect a moment of time in which I can recall saying **\[inwardly\]**, `I want to do that!`.
