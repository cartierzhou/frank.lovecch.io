title: my buried-life list.

These are the things left to do before I die. I was extremely inspired by the guys on the upcoming MTV show The Buried Life, especially since I have been pursuing one of the major items below. My list is a little bit different than theirs, as I've left out having a family, falling in love, etc (They're on a list, but not this one!). I've also left out the college-ruled, multi-page list of cars I want to own/restore and the business ideas I want to pursue; we don't have all day here. Some of the items seem trivial, but all reflect a moment in time I can recall saying, 'I want to do that!'. You might not get some of the references, but oh well :) Dream big.
