Nearly a year ago, I purchased a set of vintage luggage from a suburban Denver consignment shop, [ModMood](http://modmood.com). For years I had dreamed of non-wheeled travel baggage, and I had finally begun to travel enough to warrant a purchase. My particularities surrounding design were outlined by the luggage needing to bare resemblance to both Jimmy Stewart's gifted, never-used suitcase in _It's a Wonderful Life_, and Wes Anderson's more boisterous, metaphor-holding [Darjeeling Limited](/projects/modern-luggage) set.
