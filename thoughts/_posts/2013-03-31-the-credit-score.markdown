I heard an add on the radio about Wells Fargo giving you a free credit score report that didnt' hurt your credit score, and had a little laugh. 

rental car (this is a whole other ballgame)
renting apartment
credit card application
mortgatge application
car loan application
phone applicaiton, aadding a new line (300 deposit)

Before diving into depth, I would describe your "credit score" as a mythical number, far easier to decrease than increase, a number where measuring it "changes the result" - it's a heisennumber with no transparency which "corporations" wholly are allowed to access.
