title: An Office Divided.
quote: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.

The human condition is complicated - but understood - and yet, its mostly misconstrued by a myriad of sources. My small, [Mad-Men](http://madmen.com)-esque office space on the _ninth_ floor of the `Daniels & Fischer Tower` is no different; a tiny entity (BETTER WORD things in body...) comprised of the same triteness abundant in society **\[at least American\]**.

Below is mostly scribbles I aim to gather together. My mind continues to implore crazy.

east of eden quotes.

I work at a ~~startup~~ business in the technology sector. Bleeding-edge type shit. 

A motticum of subtle events have led to this blog; Denver has been _gloomy_, politics are in the air, and with that - `a blind hatred` and utter ignorance clouding the country. Not so surprisingly, the elections tend to bring about a fog of 

if my office divided is not a perfect correlation to this country, i dont' know what is. but what about logic and reason in the face of religion and ...brainwashing? here are studies and facts which no doubt have their own bias. lots of babies. great. but what about all the people who can't afford to have babies. they still deserve to feel the complicated emotional and physical reactions that sex brings. why should abstience be (the religous) offering that is taught? it is antiquted. relate this to europe and how they deal with alchol more repsonbily than we do. it's very referential.

let's not go into the startup thing. we're a business. and it's enterprise.

i warn you of my innate ability to ramble and reference; i feeel this to be Ok and it would be disrespectful to not acknowledge that i am the makeup of every event i've experienced, person i've met, book i've read, and film i've watched - ackwoldeging my conscious is this and my subconsious is fooey is ok. after all, it's probably a big computer simulation- link.

when does the law become detrimental, and how is one to judge this.

I was reminded of this by none other than Henry Rollins. he said somethign which i have always thougth (on drugs) regarding his led zeppelin refernce. keep the rabble down.

`You Americans are crazy. You think that this big of a place it's possible that everybody is going to agree on things and you're going to get things done. Germany is the size of X state and we have trouble.`

The curse of manifest destiny.

hunger games
it is only when i feel enclosed that i become a threat to the status quo. i would probably judge myself on what i'm saying.
compassion - the scene with the kiss to the people.

there are places i can not go and thus things i can not do. this is an outrage.

`The cult of individuals is always, in my view, unjustified. To be sure, nature distributes her gifts unevenly among her childern. But there are plenty of well-endowed, thank God, and I am firmly convinced that most of them live quite, unobtrusive lives. It strikes me as unfair, and even in bad taste, to select a few of them for boundless admiration, attributing super-human powers of mind and character to them.`

on going back to basics
The older I devastatingly become, the more I revert to simplistic elements. Maybe that's partly a lie, as I've always been drawn to that. I can't tell if this simplisticness is because there's somethign so mod (well designed?) about vintage, or sturdy feeling, but it's also the same feeling I can derive from an iPhone or macbook (in some cases). It's the feeling of good design, craftsmenship, and quality. But they are 2 different types of quality and crafstmentship. The beauty of the mechanical world and what's always enticed me is the longevity, and thus sustainability, of the items. I'd say to you, go back.

john stewart on violence. `a country that allows open satire.` why i grieve but do not despair. they live in chaos. and chaos cant' sustain (slc punk ref). chaos is too easy and too unsatisfying.
conan on being kind. (probably goes best with compassion). sam said it best - if you ca'nt sit down and find an interesting thing about someone, you're doing it wrong. everybody needs a little pushing and prodding, some more than others.

on kyle and romney.
on cutting pbs. is it the industrial enggineer in me that thinks maybe we should reconsider how jobs are spread and recondition people? cut to up the air what did you want to do. running a busines locally and making a living when i was younger never made sense. now it does. i wish somebody would have said - you're goin got be happy enjoying the simple pleasure of making and creating, whether it be food or goods, and you'er going to liek doing it in a neighborhood. you don't have to do this in a single place - you can be in multiple places thorughout the course of your life or even rotate these places seasonally, but for someone with no ties and no money this makes it more diffucult. regardless, that shouldnt stop you (revert to shaun's how much do we need).
on day dreaming.
