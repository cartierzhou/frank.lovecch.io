The maintenance engineer from Thomas Jefferson Elementary School had my car towed for continuously parking in 'staff parking' that was rented out to Pompeii employees, since the school isn't open. He has been a bastard since we lived here, yelling at me for parking there between the hours of 9 pm and 5:30 am when nobody used the spots, so I figured revenge was in order. Before leaving for my 9 am final this morning, which took all of 15 minutes, I called the towing company as 'John the Maintenance Engineer' to have HIS car towed.

I just got back from my final, and OH this feels so good, his car was towed. Hope that $125 feels good as weight off your back, bitch
