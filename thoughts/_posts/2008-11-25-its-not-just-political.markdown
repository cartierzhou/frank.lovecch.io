The election process and the recent bailouts/economic crisis have forced me to vent some things.

It's been 3 months and 23 days since I started working in Corporate America (it's capitalized because it REALLY is a place). I've seen the way it works, and the way blame games are played; as suspected, I'm not really a fan ;) I've had the chance to talk with many of the older employees during this time, and apparently (and very stereotypically), they think our generation is "worthless". I say "our" in the sense that most of you Facebookers, whether you were born a few years earlier or later than I, are considered a part of this generation. I can't say that I completely agree with this "worthless" libel, but there is definitely a base of fact there. I won't get into that just yet, as I think what lies just ahead of these words needs to be said first.

To the generation born before me (and them):

You gave us a world ripped apart at the seams, quite literally. Why should we care about fixing something which we have no tangible control over? Your so-called conservatisms have cost my generation freedoms which you constantly threatened would be protected by your decisions. You are stuck in the dark ages when it comes to religion, politics, and morality (they can, and do, differ). You are close-minded, and you have bred close-minded and apathetic children.

Like I said before, there was a base to your 'worthless' libel of us. Fact: it's mostly your fault, and yet somehow you don't realize it. I have met a LOT of your children, and they (unfortunately) comprise the overwhelming majority of my generation. They're the kind of people that get their news from FOX alone, just like you. They probably get angry when confronted about the basis of their beliefs, just like you. They can be (but rarely are) the brightest pupils in their class. It makes no difference, though, because your children will become typical people that do typical things and aspire to typical dreams, which they think will get them places (heck, you taught them this). They generally suck at life, and thankfully, get to fill your role when you die. The ones that choose not to fill your role became apathetic to politics and/or religion, probably because anything more reckless by them would have made you worried.

Then there is the rest of our generation. To quote Apple (pre-God era)...the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. We are the forward thinkers, the ones who question the basis of anything you've created. We agree with some, and disagree with much more. We differ on politics, religion, sexual preference; and yet somehow (quite unlike you) have managed to make compromises and respect each other.

We are looked upon as backwards with our 'creativity' and 'ingenuity' when it comes to issues you seek sole worldly control over, and we are more and more confused by your decisions and what you deem as 'contemporary' thinking. We are the vast minority, and you are the enemy.

The sad part is this: you think that this small portion of our generation is the 'worthless' part. Boy, have you got another thing coming.

Sincerel...scratch that. Fuck you.
