The setting: Johnny's Ice House, a hockey rink near UIC, more specifically the player's bench.

The characters: Myself and a 'Pastor' we'll call Crazy Eyes, who is probably in his 60's.

The plot: Myself is sitting on the bench minding my own business (hacking up a lung), when Crazy Eyes starts chit chatting me up.

Crazy Eyes: 'What's your name? Do you go to school? Where do you work? How old are you?'

He was pretty talkative for an old man, and since I've been trying to be less introverted, I answered his questions AND even asked him some. Here's the kicker:

Frank: 'So, what do you do?'

Crazy Eyes: 'I'm a Pastor'

Frank: 'No SHIT!'"
