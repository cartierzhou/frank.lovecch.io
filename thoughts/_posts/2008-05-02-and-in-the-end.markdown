The flawless spring night has sprung life back into my fingers, and I can type yet again.
I started at UIC five alarmingly different years ago. Living in the city was by far the best decision I have ever made. City life has spawned many terrible situations over the years, but on a night like tonight, I can't help falling head-over-heels for this Daley run kingdom. You know, in that Gable-Colbert sort of fashion. 

Upon completing the last engineering lab of college during the wee hours of the morning (my favorite), the obvious choice of tasks was trying to quantify my college experience. What I have in mind is too long for cramming into one of these notes, so I'm officially writing a short book, what I'd like to think of as my version of Lucas Scott's, 'An Unkindness of Ravens'. The working title is: 'The memoirs of a college graduate, or how I hacked the planet'. Something like that, I think :)

If you know me, you KNOW that my college experience was a bit different than most (to say the least). I wouldn't have it any other way.

For now, Rufio best demonstrates my thoughts:

'Although I can see, time is not running out

I still run behind everything.

I don't understand, I embrace every thought

every word...everything.'
