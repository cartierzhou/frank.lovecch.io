we ate simply.
you valued hardwork..
you let me take things apart.
...and picked up the slack.
you let me learn.
...and picked up the slacked.
you made me work.
so i knew what picking up the slack meant.
you gave us art.
you gave us the ability to impart our thoughts on our environment.
you gave us chaos, a little bit.
