title: cellphone<br/>word banks.
quote: Before auto-correct.
---

Data and analytics have always fascinated me. In _2009_, before I made the crossover to a _smart_ phone, I still had to manually input words into my cellphone's `word bank`. By pressing keys! I, of course, kept the paper list I used to transfer the bank from phone to phone **\[along with some annotations\]**, anticipating future laughs.
