The purposeful non-integration of words like 'cunt' in cell phone text-messaging word banks angers me.

Below is a list compiled of all the words I had to add into my cell phone, not including common names. I have also tried to include a (parenthesized) reference as to what in the hell I was thinking. It's close to being in alphabetical order, but i can't figure out how to 'sort alphabetically' in google docs, so deal with it.
