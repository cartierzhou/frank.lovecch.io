This is a very long piece of work, which I'm still writing. It won't be finished for a long time, mostly because of its importance to me, but also because of my Google tendency to leave things in beta.

I've 'played' hockey for as long as I can remember; my parents tell me I started skating when I was six, and I'm currently on the cusp of twenty-five. This particular game, more than any, has shaped me as a person in ways which I hope to finally put on paper (we all know hockey players are quite fluent with the written word). Much of my inspiration for putting this into perspective comes from a monthly article written by Pat Markham and published in Hockey Stop for about fifteen years, consecutively. Hockey Stop was the rink newspaper, housing league statistics, coaching drills, pro shop advertisements, and of course - Hockey Mom. Before I begin my story, I'll preface you with the kind of hockey player I consider myself. It is important to understand where I come from as a hockey player, not just the off-ice faults and attributes of my street-walking persona, to understand this piece. For most of my youth, because of the difference between school district birthday divisions and NIHL's, I found myself playing in two separate age brackets. Looking back, I'm greatful for the adversity; try explaining that to the younger version of me.

One season I would be playing with all my friends from school (the team which typically 'stayed together' over the years, though lacked on-ice chemistry), while the next year would be filled with new sets of players and coaches. My role on these house league teams differed greatly. I was portrayed as a role model with the off-year teams (being older), and considered to be a cohort-in-training on my friends' team, always though, playing as a defensemen.

My roster-slot on nearly every team I played for, up until my post-collegiate men's league teams, is best described by that of a solid, defensive defensemen. I was always an attribute, though rarely a major goal scorer. I considered myself a digger and a playmaker, benefiting the team more from getting into the corners first then having great hands (something which I began to attempt improvement upon in college). The one compliment I remember about myself as a player came from an old coach, Mr. Rczekozwski, at one of the first Bartlett High School Alumni games. 'You still got it, Frankie, you always were a phenomenal passer'.

I rarely took unnecessary penalties, and can't recall a single full-fledged fight my entire career. The game was never about aggression to me - it was about trying to achieve movement, flow, and flight (and have a little fun doing it). Really. Human beings live for a rush; some take it in the form of pills, and hockey players experience it by the swiftly pushing edges of steel blades into the top-layer of frozen water.

Recently, I've taken to playing offense.
