What started out as a sudo-practical joke has come full circle. Originally, I told a good friend of mine I was going to buy his domain 'name', then post something lude on it. The worst thing I could think of was the old-as-the-internet meme Goatse, but then I remembered something:<br/>'With great power comes great responsibility.'<br/><br/><br/>I have been trying to get him to move out to Colorado, his life-long dream. For that to happen, he needs a job. For a job to appropriate, he needs to be cleanly 'Googleable'. As his birthday present, I told him I wouldn't put anything too scandalous up. While I decide on which naked baby picture to post (the one with the most cheek), I will be reveling in the fact that I own his (internet) soul.<br/>jimmysperling.com. I then bought his sisters name.
