The Market is the first place in Denver I vividly remember. 

It was my first trip to Denver; during the three months I lived (camped) at the non-existant cabin, I ended it with a trip to Denver to visit Jimmy (who was visiting the Doc). I toured Red Rocks, illegally skateboarded down 16th st mall, and on a hot fall October day - zooter boarded onto Larimer St to get something cholocotay (the Doc has cravings much like you). It took me 2 years in  Denver to correlate this place with the place I refound.

I know why I instantly fell in love with it - it's Carm's - an italian grocery store and sub shob in Little Italy - on steroids. Wood floors, rustic metal/wood tables....packages of things everywhere. Classsical musci playing :)

It's ostencaticously noticeable from the street - a faded royal blue and white striped ...thing...cover the entrance. Miraculously, the same tables that exist perpetually outside also are the ones on the interior (dryness FTW). As yo uenter, there is a coffee bar on the left, with assorted seating opposite. A simple drink menu of coffee, tea, and smoothies - and Eddie, a kind, middle-aged barista. The coffee bar also houses the pastries made in house. I always have to get one, even if I only eat a smidge - they have a 5 dollar min on credit cards. The coffee bar is filled with mini cholocalates and sweets of all kinds, and a ceramic pig houses suggested quarter fees for refills. (sometimes i feed the piggy dollars).

I like to get here early on weekdays - the place quickly fills up. Seating is tight, and hard to walk through. It's one of those things which makes you slightly annoyed but have fond rememberances for.

There's a group of men in the mornign - always - that sit at the table in the window. I've tried to listen to their conversations but mostly it's old men talk. I think you need to be 60+ to understand.
