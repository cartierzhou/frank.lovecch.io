My parents, in their sub-consciously Protestant ways, `forced` a job on me at _fifteen_ years old; consequently, I picked up a lot of skills **\[and interests\]** along the way. I felt it important, for nostalgia's sake, to pen the aggregate workforce experiences unique to me in the past _twelve_ years. A look back at what I've done for a dollar.
