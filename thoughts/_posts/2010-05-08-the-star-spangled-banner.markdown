I have never been emotionaly moved by a live performance of the song. You can call it un-American, maybe even Communist, but I spent a great deal of hours researching performances on YouTube, and eventually figured out what made them so uninspiring.
 
 
I just spent the last hour combing through YouTube performances of our national anthem after stumbling onto Demi Lovato's recent rendition, and finally felt it was time to delve into the intricacies that make or break a performance of it. There are a handful of decent articles on the intranets regarding the best/worst performances, so I tried to dig a little deeper.

I've viewed renditions by these celebrities and viral video stars, the ones with * being likeable (I'll try to link them in the future):

I scribbled a few notes down while viewing. My funniest and angriest: 'Meatloaf?', and 'As we honor God and America? Fuck that.'
After googling 'best national anthem performances', there seem to be a few celebrity renditions I can't find video of, and are not on the list above - Kate Smith's being one, and Meatloaf's being the other. Notes on what makes or break a performance: 1) Great vocals can be ruined by over-powering music, and often are. 2) Air Force flyovers, more than one flag on the field, and dancing of any sort portray only one thing: gaudiness3)You can tell if the performer is up there for themselves, or to work. 4) Tempo, tempo, tempo. I want to sing along with you.

My favorite performance was the one I mentioned in the beginning, by Demi Lovato. She has a powerful voice, though not quite perfect, and that attracted me to the rendition. Beauty is often in the dimples and scars, and in the case of a musician, a little raspiness. She also sang certain portions differently than I've ever heard, but not so for off the wall that you wanted to punch her in the face for over-bearing personal touches. A few times during the performance she smiled at the stadium's cheering reception, and it was so genuine... that I smiled back :)
