<h2>[my digital life]</h2>
Most of what I want publicly exposed **\[to my loved ones and the world\]** exists in these places: [http://aws.amazon.com](Amazon Web Services), [http://github.com/franklovecchio](Github), [http://heroku.com](Heroku), and [http://gmail.com](Gmail). All of my computer backups, music, and important digital files are backed up in Amazon's cloud. All of my public/private applications I've written are on Github **\[see the cicular cat.

See video for instructions.

I have my digital life in three places, a
1) As far as social websites go, please keep my Facebook profile and my websites up.  You can access the passwords to these places by finding the current computer I use and opening up a web browser.
    -Please post "The Unfinished & Unpublished Works of Frank LoVecchio" as my last Facebook note.  You will find the document in my Google Docs (password from said place above) and should only have to copy and paste it.  Just make sure the spacing is correct, etc.  
	-Please make sure Claire Bow gets "Defining Moments, Revisted" from my Google Docs.  If possible, find way to contact her (facebook.com/clairevbow) and get her to the funeral/wake.
    -Please make my last Facebook/Twitter status simply "cheers to the dash". 
2) Make sure I am cremated - I do not wish to be seen lying in a casket.  My ashes are not to be put in an urn, I should like them in a simple aluminum box.   I want to be buried under a Joshua Tree overlooking my land in San Luis, Colorado.  There are only a few sage brush plants that seem to sprout much higher than the rest, and you can't miss them - that is a Joshua Tree.  You can bury the box of ashes, and I would like a small stone marker:  "Here rests the remains of Frank LoVecchio.  Don't step on him."
3) Funeral/Wake arrangements
    I don't like funeral homes, and I don't want a typical wake/funeral arrangement.  Instead, please hold 1 day of mourning (post-cremation) somewhere where alcohol can flow readily, memories can be told, and goodbyes can be said.  I also request that either dad or the boys drive the Camaro to wherever the event is held.
