Yesterday, someone that I worked with at [2lemetry](http://2lemetry.com) was let go, and it kicked off a whirlwind of emotions and thoughts in my head, all presented before you. It's been _two_ years, _two_ months, and _twenty-two_ days **\[really\]** since I became a non-degreed, full-time developer; I haven't published anything significant about this lifestyle choice since. `That pretty much sums it up, though`. I started along this path at the age of _eighteen_ - that being the first time I typed `telnet` into a [Putty](http://putty.org) terminal - and can't recall a time _not_ being fascinated by the world of [Dade Murphy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/). `I have been in non-stop code-mode`; it hasn't really stopped since I first typed `telnet` into a [Putty](http://putty.org) terminal at the age of _eighteen_. During my time as a real-life developer, sometimes, I forgot about [what originally brought me out here](http://frank.lovecch.io/projects/walden-ranch.html); other times, I forgot about the [fundamental staples](http://www.paulgraham.com/todo.html). On New Years Day, this _two-thousand and twelve_, I wrote the words `Be Better` on a dry-erase board - I haven't looked back **\[except, of course, when trying to transfer my websites from PHP gibberish to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)...which is still in progress\]**.

<h2>Moving On</h2>
Our startup is a small mix of who's here and who's not; our Eastern European resources being the latter. Everybody knows who's on the line for what, transparency is inflicted without thought. I thought about writing something [Jerry Maguire-esque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH64hzWqnFk) at first, just to the older founders - internally - just to sort of put myself out there more than I have in the past. It's interesting being younger and less knowldeable when it comes to various, if not most, aspects of the business; it reminds me of sitting in the back of the classroom **\[my first choice in any new environment\]**. The back of the classroom, just like being a young developer - a young anything - allows you to take in not just the things being taught to you, but more of a global knowledege of what is happening. `I found I learned more in the back of the classroom about the environment and people in it then I ever could have at the front`. 

There are two rather large developer communities, at least as I see it - Hacker News, and Stack Overflow. On occasion, as it is with general human stuff, I see down-talking to developers less in the know. Sometimes, they're right - documentation wasn't read, you were lazy. Other times, 


Then I read [this](http://leostartsup.com/2012/08/the-myth-of-doing-%E2%80%9Cthat-one-thing%E2%80%9D/) blog I found on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.org) while waiting for [code to compile](). Being from Chicago, it's obvious I'm aware of [NPR](http://npr.org), [This American Life](thisamericanlife.org/), and Ira Glass' [inspiring](http://vimeo.com/24715531) video. The thing is, `when you're dead on, you're dead-fucking-on`. And Ira...he was nailed it - so, I decided that a bigger post was in order.

Now that I've been in the business of developing **\[[freely](https://sabisushi.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/the-man-who-saved-sabi/) as [http://github.com/franklovecchio](well) \]** for a period of time, and going through various stages of [ups](http://blog.cloudspokes.com/2012/08/first-time-submitter-challenge-july.htmlr) and [downs](http://www.x.org), **\[never once getting front-page status anywhere - a [Buried Life list](http://www.theburiedlife.com/) task\]**, I can safely say that...I'm still here, I'm still learning and developing,

My prior-art previous-to this world was Aerospace, but that was never going to cut it for me. **\[formerly working as a hands-on _Production Engineer_ in the Aerospace field\]**,

Before I was aware of what the [Internet of Things](http://www.theinternetofthings.eu/) was called, I wanted it. I can recall desigining [TI-83](http://education.ti.com/catalog/83plus) golf-ball finders as a Freshman, and I'm pretty sure I designed the PS2 before it even came out. I've always wanted integration, and it wasn't until ripping apart old automobile electronics that I discovered my love for the combination of this does that. 

<h2>It's Never Enough</h2>
`There is always someone better out there`. I first heard this said by my father when I was playing hockey at a young age **\[_twelve_ or so\]** in reference to other players. I was a defensemen my whole life, and a rather good one at that. I was a defensive-defenseman, though - I could thwart the best of them with a simple poke-check. To be the best, though, you had to have good hands and do what I did. It was this niche I played into my whole life, only occasionally venturing out of that. `When I started playing beer-league hockey, I started playing offense`. Something changed during my
