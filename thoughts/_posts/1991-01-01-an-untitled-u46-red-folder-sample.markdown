title: u-46 red folder.
quote: I never owned a hamster as a pet.

I attended _four_ different public schools in my lifetime, all of which belonged to the most corrupt district in the state of Illinois: _U46_. Before computers were widely available to these kinds of places, paper copies of _everything_ were _de facto_. A red folder full of writing samples, dating back to _1991_ **\[when I first entered the district\]**, was given to me as part of the graduation boot. The favorite? An untitled sample from _third_ grade **\[including grammatical errors\]**.

I want a hamster. I will feed it and by a cage for it. If I have to I'll clean up after it, and name it. If I get a white hamster I'll name it snowy. If I get a light brown one I will name it Soda Pop.The cage will be a lot of money but I can afford it. I will buy a fridge and a glass boot that says 'Home Sweet Home'. It will also have a spinny wheel and tunnels. The hamster food will be a big bag and money to. I will buy a couple bags of it. When I run out I'll go back to the store to get some. If I have to clean up after it. I will buy a little shovel and put a garbage bag in my room. After I do that I will put some more brown stuff in the cage. I want a hamster. I'm going to feed it, clean up after it, buy a cage for it and name it.
