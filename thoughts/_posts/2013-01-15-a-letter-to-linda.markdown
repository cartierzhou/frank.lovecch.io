When a friend and I moved into `2547 River Drive`, it was falling apart. We let some things slide because rent was _twelve-hundred_ dollars, and the location was cherry - I could walk to work downtown! Unfortunately, when we moved out, it wasn't in much better condition, and when I received word the lady managing the house wanted to renovate it and charge us for prior damanges **\[charging us twice our security deposit\]**, I wrote a letter with gusto. `In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have called her a twit`, but I felt taken advantage of.

Linda,

I knew you were a twit the moment you assumed the microwave was melted. Any logical-minded, non-twit would have simply pulled the plastic wrap off to reveal a beautiful facade (it took me all of 2 seconds to realize this was the issue).

Let's get this straight: I'm not paying any of these so-called "extra damages" you speak of; had you done proper due diligence before we moved in, you would have noticed a majority of these issues in existence already. If you decide to come after me for more money, I'll have the house condemned by the city.

Frankly (see what I did there), the relationship which existed between us during our stay was that of a use-use kind - we ignored the wiring that wasn't up to code, the water pressure that didn't exist, the ruining of my mattress when the shower pipes burst, etc., all trade-offs for cheaper rent.

In regards to the list of so-called "damages" and our responsibility for them:

1) At no point in time did we ever pry any doors open. The door had holes in it from the beginning, and any damage you see is a result of it not closing properly.

2) The toilet in the basement became stained from lack of use. This is because the bathroom was disgusting from the moment we moved in, so we used it as little as possible.

3) The light in the shower was pulled off the wall when we moved in.

4) The carpet in the bedroom was mostly covered by a bed the entire duration of our stay; its an impossibility for it to be "completely ruined". But if by ruined, you really mean "bug covered", than I believe this to be your problem...the windows lack screens!

5) We noticed many of the floor boards were overly worn when we moved in. Wood floors do become worn over time - it's called general wear and tear, and that's the owner's responsibility. Sorry for walking.

6) The blinds the former resident (Joaquin) purchased when he left to replace the broken blinds were not the proper size.

7) At no point in time did we drill any holes or have any drilled. Direct TV was installed when we moved in - the place was wired up already. Pay attention.

In regards to the basement room, saying I "nicked" a water pipe makes no sense. The water pipes sit on top of the drywall of the ceiling. They sit so delicately, in fact, that slight pressure on the ceiling starts a water leak. I'll happily accept the $150 deduction from our $1200 deposit on that.

I'll be ignoring any responses from you, so no need for a rebuttal. Use some logic when coming to conclusions; ignorance and laziness are not excuses.

Thanks,

Frank
