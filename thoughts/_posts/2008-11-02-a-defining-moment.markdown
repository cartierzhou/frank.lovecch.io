In order to understand this, you will have to first read the note I wrote two years ago, 'Defining Moments', and then REALLY read this comic: http://xkcd.com/137/.

I have finally been able to catch a defining moment in the act.

I was sitting at my desk in Corporate America when it happened. After an interesting troubleshooting meeting, I finally had some down-time in between projects. Naturally, I checked up on my Gmail and Facebook, per usual. I started randomly clicking through XKCD comics after exhausting those sites, and I stumbled upon the aformentioned XKCD #137, entitled 'Dreams'

I read it twice, and then hovered the mouse over the comic for the extra blurb the author always includes in the comics (If you get excited for the hidden track on CD's, then you can understand my excitement for the hover). I sat there in a subdued shock post-reading, and I have to reckon this was the effect of every thought in my head inked onto paper by someone else. The comic is titled 'Dreams', but it might as well be called 'Truth'.

I have never been the kind of guy to follow the status-quo and make decisions based on the majority's opinion, but every so often I need a reminder of why, a morale booster if you will (No, I won't?).

THIS was a reminder. My assault on the world begins now.
