I can accept I am but a [bag of meat, sitting on a rock in outer space](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/religion), and that there is [probably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism) nothing to this thing but that which we have created for ourselves. I _do_ consciously hope there is some semblance of magic humans are not privy to understanding - other than [turtle upon turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down), of course.

In using the above as a foundation, I have _never_ found my morals to be compromised; logic, [gut](http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669), and feelings have helped structure these more clearly than any religion could have.

```
I would rather live fully, bound by no physical patriotisms, with a moral code imposed on my own terms - taken subjectively from all religions, using my personal feelings and thoughts as a guide - than wager with Pascal about the after-life.

<h2>[tangent]</h2>
The effect Aaaron Swartz's suicide **\[and its aftermath\]** had on me was [more tremendous](http://discountgeni.us/2013/01/13/why-am-i-so-upset-about-aaron-swartzs-suicide/) than I anticipated. I have been _attempting_ to write this piece for a couple months, saving links and writing snippets as thoughts gathered. And _then_ the precipice came to be - my girlfriend and I watched _two_ very important people in Aaron's life [give their eulogies](http://www.livestream.com/democracynow/share?clipId=pla_f83c80fe-0fc0-474c-9936-efe8659466f6).

I have always felt `vigorously` different in regards to the paths I chose, but never did the word [marvelous](http://danwin.com/2013/01/edward-tufte-aaron-swartz-marvelously-different/) seem appropriate; _I will always be my toughest critic_. 

<h2>[/tangent]</h2>
I consider the writings bequeated to us by the founding forefathers of this country the culmination of knowledge and ethics regarding political institutions _up to to that point_. I think the ideals represented in _The Declaration of Independence_, _The Consititution_, and _[The Bill of Rights](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html)_ are generous gifts to the mind and spirit, `being crafted of a people whom had dreams to spare and realities which killed - this is how I know there is good in them`. 

```
And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about.

- John Steinbeck, East of Eden

All systems implmented by man are _fallible_, and as such, we have continually missed the most important aspects of the documents at hand. Just as once-inky text has faded from parchment, passing of time has led to the systematic degredation of rights through _graft_ and _greed_ and men who never understood anything but `gaslighting` and only had dreams of [phooey](http://www.amazon.com/Like-You-Sandol-Stoddard-Warburg/dp/0395071763).

```
The cult of individuals is always, in my view, unjustified. To be sure, nature distributes her gifts unevenly among her childern. But there are plenty of well-endowed, thank God, and I am firmly convinced that most of them live quite, unobtrusive lives.

- Albert Einstein, Ideas and Opionions

The multitude of settings establishing America are full of so many people, born here and not. 

As an American, I can tell you I don't care if you were born here or not. You and I seek the same things.

There is no conflict of interest between rationale men.

As an American, it is my choice to live how I like - visidely, religiously, healhilhty, outdoorsy. I do not need a degree to be better.

TODO To be clear...discuss doctrines and give examples of the bible and how those are followed to closely.

<h2>[patriotism]</h2>
Nearly the [entirety](http://jacquesmattheij.com/life-as-a-service) of who you are is derived from the location in which you were birthed. Religious zealots are amazingly good at ignoring this fact. I for one, am certain I was given no choice on the matter of where I would be born unto **\[this isn't a [Non Sequitir](http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur) comic\]**; as things stand, my hospital-issued birth certificate retains a stamped address bearing _The United States of America_. Lucky me.


<h2>[the bill of rights]</h2>
Some text some test.

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">1. Amendment I</p>

```
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

<h2>[conclusions]</h2>

The doctrine I have decided appropriate almost seems in some respects like thoughts a young _Howard Roarke_ would have.

1. Ingore man-made obstacles and man-made systems. 

At the root of every parking ticket or spike in hourly parking rate in a city is fiscal mismangaement. At the root of fiscal mismanagement is laziness (and possibly corruption). As I've said before, jobs for people is not a subsitute

we've missed the utopian ideal of place where the only patriotism exists in the form of causes.

This is a place where men - _a single mind_ - is allowed to thrive, where 

I am of the stance that disallowances in freedom of speech sit on the end of a board, while the entire concept resides on the other. Slowly, revisions occur - yelling "fire" in a theatre becomes illegal -

As the years have passed and unaccounted greedI fear much of the blood shed for _inalienable rights_ may have been in vain, but I am unsure yet as to the particular cause. 

1. They could not have foreseen population to increase with such size; Are men capable of governing such a massivity?

1. How do our commoners (e.g. the middle class - myself) compare with those of the early revolutionary periods? Are we more learned in various ways but has technology generally decreased "common sense"?

1. They could not have foreseen the burden of technology. 

A lot of the blood shed,

How is it that we've lost touch with the ideals the country was founded on? Over 200 years ago, in Amendment 1 of the Bill of Rights, we stated "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion". H.J. Resolution 396 completely disregards entire facets of the country by overthrowing "E Pluribus Unum" as our unofficial motto, and making it "In God We Trust". I do not trust in God, and I'm not sure I trust in my government. I am torn.


<h2>[i have a dream]</h2>
I too, have dreams; many of them cooincide with Aaron's, as it turns out. As I stammer my way through the obstacles eventually leading me into **\[or completely away\]** from politics, I am coming to find my rights slowly eroded; and chances of `non-violent revolution` become more favored towards the house. Violence and I have never had a true relationship, and my thoughts on it are best described by a post-911 John Stewart:

`[We live in] a country that allows open satire, [which is] why I grieve...but do not despair. They live in chaos, and chaos can't be sustained. Chaos is too easy and too unsatisfying.`

There is a line which must be drawn in the sand. On one side, modern revolution that comes with violence and death. On the side I stand, non-violence exixt - a real use for technology and the people who know how to use it. 


`Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.
