Going back to as far as I can remember, here is a list of songs/albums that I associate with certain things or instantaneously changed my perspective.  I don't want to fix my grammatical mistakes because I need a nap.

1st grade

Vanilla Ice, Ninja Rap

Let's face it, we all loved the Ninja Turtles. I can remember this song being played on the radio in the STATION WAGON as I was being driven home from the baby sitter. To this day, any station wagon from 1965-pre Dogde Magnum gives me the chills.

6th grade

Space Jam Soundtrack, specifically R. Kelly, 'I believe I can fly'

Funny story. The year I couldn't get enough of Nintendo 64's Mario 64 was also the year I first encountered this soundtrack. Not only did my dad and I play 'Basketball Jones' numerous times on the way back from hockey in the LEBARON CONVERTIBLE, I used to take Mario to the snow level (you know, the first one where you take the little elevator up, jump off, and catch the wind blowing so you can fly), turn on 'I believe I can fly', and watch Mario fly into the snowy abyss. I know, I was nerd.


7th/8th grade

Brian Setzer Orchestra, 'The Dirtie Boogie' (Album)

Another favorite while driving in the Lebaron with my pops. I had never really heard SWING music, or the updated version of it, but it was poppy and jumpy (my vocab is lacking here). There was one hit tune on this album, 'Jump, Jive 'n Wail', but the rest of the album rocked all the way through. It broadened my musical horizons greatly, leading to the Stray Cats, Frank Sinatra, and ...



9th/10th grade

Mob Hits Soundtrack

If I didn't excrete dego before, I sure did after this stage. It was Mr. O's geography class, and there was quite a good mixture of people in there. Mr. O is the guy that taught me how to remember where Yemen and Omen were in relation to each other. Picture this: a 5'4 nerdy white male, ex-track runner, yelling'YA MAN, NO MAN' at near-full vocal capacity and acting out yes and no facial expressions while pointing at a map. Ah, digression. Back to the music! This was the time I discovered the wonderful melodies of Bobby Darin, Rosemary Clooney, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Vale, the classics. Before every class I'd put in the Mob Hits CD and play a song or two, and Mr. O would dance a little jig. Looking back, people must have really thought I was such a strange kid. Fuck 'em, just 'Mambo Italiano'! 



10th grade

Bill Cosby, 'To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With' (Album)

I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was at Jill Ricci's house, and I was infatuated with her father's record player - for some reason the record players at my house were all broken. (more on this later) I couldn't remember EVER hearing a record play, so I found a comedy album, and played it. If you think Dane Cook or Mitch Hedburg is funny, you should've heard Bill Cosby in his prime. I don't think I ever laughed so hard, the material was so easy to relate to if you ever had siblings.



10th grade summer Usher, 'Twerk it out'

Kind of an odd song to put on this list, but this was the summer of the Camaro. I was trying my best to wire up a CD player into the car, as the god damned tape player was getting annoying. The only CD I had lying around was 8701, Usher's brand spanking new album (think 'You remind me', not that Little John shite). Whenever I would get a speaker wired, I'd test the player and here 'Twerk it out', it grows on you ;) I should here this song and think of a woman (boobs, va jay jay, the works), but all I think of is my darling Camaro. HA.



11th grade

Paul Simon, 'Still crazy after all these years' (Album) The reason all the record players were broken, I was informed by the rentals, is that I was a devil child. I broke every needle on every player, and my parents never replaced them. So when I stumbled upon my dad's ancient 1960's mahogany player, I made him buy a needle. After a little greasing of the linkages inside, I grabbed the Paul Simon album and put it on. Now, at this time I had never heard Simon without Garfunkel, but when 'Still crazy after all these years came on', I got an instant music high.



11th grade

DJ Sammy, 'Heaven'

I remember hearing 'Heaven' MANY times on the radio while driving around with Jimmy Sperling in his 90's era Dodge Caravan with a flaming read interior. Some of these 'trips' resulted in someone getting thrown into a forest while driving, and some resulted in created mattress barriers on Mayflower Lane. But hey, that's another story. Many-a-hearing combined with Snider's non-stop dance CD's made me like techno. Too Kool Chris? Hell, yes.



12th grade Senior Year - The year of Styx. I came across a Styx CD at tower records in the on-sale bin, popped it into the CD player in the 'maro, and I was hooked. Dennis DeYoung was a GOD. I liked classic rock/80's rock before, but this stuff made me REALLY listen to it...and it led to Rush, Def Leppard, Van Halen, etc. Hell, my senior yearbook quote was 'If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice. -Rush' To this day, I still want to learn how to play 'Lady' on the piano, if only I had a working keyboard in my apartment. COUGH, Robyn.



Freshman Year, UIC Billy Joel, 'The Stranger' (Album)

UIC has come quite a ways since my freshman year. I lived in the most amazingly awesome piece of shit west side dorm imaginable, SRH. It really doesn't look anything like it used to, but the people were good, and that's what counts eh? Well, in my dorm room I had a $5 dollar garage sale record player that skipped unless you put $1.00 worth of quarters on the head (over the needle). I only had a few records as space was tight, and it rotated from Duran Duran to Billy Joel to Paul Simon. Most notoriously though, I played Billy Joel's 1977 LP 'The Stranger'. I originally grabbed it from my house for one song, 'Only the good die young', but in reality I ended up REALLY liking 'Vienna' -t played constantly. 



Freshman Year, UIC

Fall Out Boy, 'Take This to Your Grave'

New Found Glory 'New Found Glory'

Yellowcard 'Ocean Avenue'

Thank you Chris Nielson. This man, my dorm roomy freshman year, was just getting out of his New Found Glory stage (he said they sold out), and thanks to him, I was getting into it. Pre-computer nerd Frank (yes, I used to not be a computer guy) downloaded mostly Sinatra-esque songs in his limey SRH dorm. Once I ACTUALLY listened to these albums, I fell in love (I can listen to all 3, straight through, STILL). Huge doors opened, and my music world would never be the same. It lead to discovering The Academy Is..., Motion City Soundtrack, Saves the Day, and even rediscovering Blink :)



Sophomore Year, UIC

'The Garden State Soundrack'

Zach Braff couldn't have randomly picked a better CD from his portable discman. This soundtrack does wonders for the soul. 
Junior Year, UIC

Wicked, 'Defying Gravity'

Thanks to drunken Roosevelt students singing the soundtrack, (AMY DEAL AMBER COARTNEY), I heard this song before I had even seen the musical. I loved it indefinitely after. Why? Hmm...we'll call it empowering. So what if it was written for angst ridden teenage girls who feel out of place with all their bodily and mental changes? I don't care. Me and David Rupe, yes - Mr. IIE President himself, listened to this soundtrack while studying (me? study?) for Circuit Analysis on multiple occasions. More door opening, worlds colliding, and all of a sudden my interest in musicals soared.


NOW, UIC

Across the Universe Soundtrack

The Beatles. Forever. I saw Paul, Ringo, John Jr. (whatever his name his), and Yoko on Larry King Live not too long ago. Paul said that people still come up to him and say, 'thanks for the music'. Maybe the music is so influential again because the tide of revolution is strong with the young ones? (I'll stop with politics, and stick to music...although, they might go hand in hand) 

When I was a child, I spoke as a child...fuck that's a Hacker's line (maybe the bible too?). No, what I really mean is, when I was child, I listened to The Beatles music, but I shied away from the darker stuff. As I got older, I tried it out a bit, hoping that it wouldn't ruin the band for me, and it didn't. But I still wasn't really DISCOVERING it, ya know? Then I see Across the Universe, a movie I had been anticipating since I saw a preview for it a year.5 before it came out. Revolution. Slightly different takes on the songs, some artsy, some not. But here I am, more impressed with the music now than ever before. 

Semi-funny Papa Lovecchio comment relating to the above writing: So I come home for Halloween with my hair shaggy in all it's glory, and he says, 'What are you supposed to be for Halloween? The Beatles?' My reply, 'Yes, dad. All of them.'



NOW, UIC The Rocket Summer, 'Hello Good Friend' (Album)

Thanks to my sister for introducing me to this. Talk about a completely different take on the old piano/vocal routine. I haven't been able to get these songs out of my head for MONTHS, and it's definitely a good thing ;)
