quote: And what it means to be an American.

```
I would rather live fully, bound by no physical patriotisms, with a moral code imposed on my own terms - taken subjectively from all religions, using my personal feelings and thoughts as a guide - than wager with Pascal about the after-life.
```

I consider the writings bequeated to us by the founding forefathers of this country the culmination of knowledge and ethics regarding political institutions up to to that point. I think the ideals represented in _The Declaration of Independence_, _The Consititution_, and _[The Bill of Rights](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html)_ are generous gifts to the mind and spirit, `being crafted from a people whom had dreams to spare and realities which killed - this is how I know there is good in them`. 

```
And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about.
```

All systems implmented by man are infallible, and as such, we've continually missed the most important aspects of the documents at hand. Just as the once inky-text has faded, the passing of time has led to the systematic degredation of rights through _graft_ and _greed_ and men who never understood anything but power and dreams of _phooey_.

The multitude of settings establishing America are full of so many people, born here and not. 

As an American, I can tell you I don't care if you were born here or not. You and I seek the same things.

```
There is no conflict of interest between rationale men.

As an American, it is my choice to live how I like - visidely, religiously, healhilhty, outdoorsy. I do not need a degree to be better.

<h2>[patriotism]</h2>
I am certain I was given no choice on the matter of where I would be born unto **\[this isn't a _Non-Sequitur_ comic\]**; as things stand, my hospital-issued birth certificate retains a stamped address bearing _The United States of America_.

1. Amendment I

```
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The doctrine I have decided appropriate almost seems in some respects like thoughts a young _Howard Roarke_ would have.

1. Ingore man-made obstacles and man-made systems. 

At the root of every parking ticket or spike in hourly parking rate in a city is fiscal mismangaement. At the root of fiscal mismanagement is laziness (and possibly corruption). As I've said before, jobs for people is not a subsitute

we've missed the utopian ideal of place where the only patriotism exists in the form of causes.

This is a place where men - _a single mind_ - is allowed to thrive, where 

I am of the stance that disallowances in freedom of speech sit on the end of a board, while the entire concept resides on the other. Slowly, revisions occur - yelling "fire" in a theatre becomes illegal -

As the years have passed and unaccounted greedI fear much of the blood shed for _inalienable rights_ may have been in vain, but I am unsure yet as to the particular cause. 

1. They could not have foreseen population to increase with such size; Are men capable of governing such a massivity?

1. How do our commoners (e.g. the middle class - myself) compare with those of the early revolutionary periods? Are we more learned in various ways but has technology generally decreased "common sense"?

1. They could not have foreseen the burden of technology. 

A lot of the blood shed,

How is it that we've lost touch with the ideals the country was founded on? Over 200 years ago, in Amendment 1 of the Bill of Rights, we stated "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion". H.J. Resolution 396 completely disregards entire facets of the country by overthrowing "E Pluribus Unum" as our unofficial motto, and making it "In God We Trust". I do not trust in God, and I'm not sure I trust in my government. I am torn.
