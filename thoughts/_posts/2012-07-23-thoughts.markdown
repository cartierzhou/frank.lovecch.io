`My favorite layer of a book is the dedication`; whether it be a mysterious shout-out or an elaborate, loving thank-you, I find comfort, inspiration, and happiness in them.  People always ask, `Do you have a favorite?`. To answer, my **\[rather odd\]** most beloved happens to be printed on the interior cover of a fictional book, in a fictional movie, where all the characters are just...fictional. It reads, very simply, `To J.L.W.` This seemingly effortless statement fused with the dramatic pause in which it is read `affected me enough to inspire a twelve-hundred mile move` **\[more on that, later\]**.

Throughout my life I've periodically chronicled thoughts and feelings which were expressive of the moment; `some defining`, some not. `This is my attempt to polish and bring to fruition the reflections placed on the shelves of my mind`. Some of what I lay before you may seem rough around the edges, and that's ok; `in my attempt` to do the [Slow-Web Movement](http://theslowweb.com/) justice, making sure the prose doesn't lack poise or [good taste](http://vimeo.com/24715531) is taking some time.

As it is, the digital representation of my mind.
