`My favorite layer of a book is the dedication`; whether it be a mysterious shout-out or an elaborate, loving thank-you, I find comfort, inspiration, and happiness in them.  People always ask, `Do you have a favorite?` To answer, my **\[rather odd\]** most beloved happens to be printed on the interior cover of a fictional book, in a fictional movie, where all the characters are just...fictional **\[see what I did, there?\]**. It reads: `To J.L.W.` This seemingly effortless statement fused with the dramatic pause in which it was read `affected me enough to inspire a twelve-hundred mile move` **\[more on that, later\]**.

I have periodically chronicled thoughts and feelings which were expressive of the moment - `some defining`, some not. `This is my attempt to port, polish and bring to fruition introspections placed on the back shelf of my mind`, in hopes that they will do for you what dedications _do_ for me. Some of the thoughts layed before you can be rough around the edges and tough to decipher in their existing format...and this is to be expected! Following the mantra of the [Slow-Web Movement](http://theslowweb.com/) - making sure the prose lacks no poise or misses [good taste](http://vimeo.com/24715531) - is taking some time.

As it is, the digital representation of my mind.
