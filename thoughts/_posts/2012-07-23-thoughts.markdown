My favorite part of a book is the dedication; whether it be a mysterious etitude or an elaborate, loving thank-you note, I find comfort and inspiration in them. My (rather-odd) favorite happens to be printed on the inside of a fictional book...in a fictional movie. It reads, "To J.L.W.". It was this simple statement and the context of the dramatic pause in which it is read which moved me enough to inspire a twelve-hundred mile move. 

Throughout my life I've periodically chronicled thoughts and feelings which were expressive of the moment; some defining, some not. Regardless, I share them with you.
