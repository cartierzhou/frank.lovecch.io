I can accept I am but a [bag of meat, sitting on a rock in outer space](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/religion), and that there is [probably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism) _nothing_ to this thing but that which we have created for ourselves. But, I _do_ consciously hope there is some semblance of magic in existance which we dinky humans are not privy to understanding - something other than [turtle upon turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down), of course.

In using the above as a foundation, I have _never_ found my morals to be compromised; logic, [gut](http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669), and feelings have helped structure these more clearly than any religion could have. If I had to break this down into a mission statement:

```
I would rather live fully, bound by no physical patriotisms, with a moral code imposed on my own terms - taken subjectively from all religions, using my personal feelings and thoughts as a guide - than wager with Pascal about the after-life.
```

<h2>[tangent]</h2>
The effect Aaaron Swartz's suicide **\[and its aftermath\]** had on me was [more tremendous](http://discountgeni.us/2013/01/13/why-am-i-so-upset-about-aaron-swartzs-suicide/) than I anticipated. I have been _attempting_ to write this piece for many months, saving links and writing snippets as my thoughts gathered. _Then_ the precipice of the reactions came to be - my girlfriend and I watched _two_ very important people in Aaron's life [give their eulogies](http://www.livestream.com/democracynow/share?clipId=pla_f83c80fe-0fc0-474c-9936-efe8659466f6).

I have always felt `vigorously` different in regards to the paths I chose, but the word [marvelous](http://danwin.com/2013/01/edward-tufte-aaron-swartz-marvelously-different/) never seemed appropriate **\[I will always be my toughest critic\]**. My intentions here lie with making the purpose behind those chosen paths known, while also introducing myself into an area I am not entirely comfortable with entering.

<h2>[/tangent]</h2>
I consider the writings bequeated to us by the founding fathers of this country the culmination of knowledge and ethics regarding political institutions _up to to that point_. The ideals represented in _[The Declaration of Independence](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html)_, _[The Consititution](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html)_, and _[The Bill of Rights](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html)_ are generous gifts to the mind and spirit, `being crafted of a people whom had dreams to spare and realities which killed` - this is how I know there is much truth and good in them.

And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about.
- John Steinbeck, East of Eden
```

What I am oppositely about is illogical reliance upon institutionalized pieces of writing; the gems listed above are not exceptions. One only has to look at how an extremist thinks and lives - political or religious - to gain insight as to why they should be consumed with a salt-shaker in hand. The problem which exists, though - _irrational, fear-mongering debochery_ - was not only foreseen, but self-documenting:

```
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes.
```

**Prudence, indeed**. But what of it?

_Discretion_, at least definitively, is open to interpretation.

All systems implemented by man are _fallible_. Just as once-inky text has faded from the parchments we _held_ so high, passing of time has led to the systematic degredation of _our_ rights through _graft_ and _greed_ ...discretions... and men who never understood anything but `gaslighting` and only had dreams of [phooey](http://www.amazon.com/Like-You-Sandol-Stoddard-Warburg/dp/0395071763).

The cult of individuals is always, in my view, unjustified. To be sure, nature distributes her gifts unevenly among her childern. But there are plenty of well-endowed, thank God, and I am firmly convinced that most of them live quite, unobtrusive lives.

<h2>[patriotisms]</h2>
Nearly the [entirety](http://jacquesmattheij.com/life-as-a-service) of your influences are derived from the location in which you were born. Religious zealots are amazingly good at ignoring this fact. I, for one, am certain there was no choice given to me on the matter **\[this is not a [Non Sequitir](http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur) comic, after all...or is it?\]**. As things stand, my hospital-issued birth certificate retains a stamped address located in _The United States of America_. Lucky me.

Growing up here meant growing up cowboy; we've all got an inkling of John Wayne in us. It is noticeable when comparing myself to _every_ European I have _ever_ encountered: I find myself to be more direct, but less frigid. Casual is as casual does. More wasteful. More impermeable. 

I understand stereotypes of Americans aren't far off, physically, from much of the population - sneakers, jeans, and an XL t-shirt, but the real beauty of living here is that we are all vastly, distinctly, different. Of course we can't come to an agreement on anything. **But that's the point of this place.** It's a safe haven for the world's different. The very principles we founded ourselves upon _should_ have made this apparent, but the words inscribed in the stanzas on our Lady of Liberty somehow went out of fashion.

I was born in a place where I can fly the flag, **or burn it**, just as righteously. This is a good problem to have, but not the on

As an American, it is my choice to live how I like - visidely, religiously, healhilhty, outdoorsy. I do not need a degree to be better.

<h2>[the bill of rights]</h2>

Most of the rights gauranteed to the citizens of this country have been stricken from us in times of fear; it is understandably human nature to do so, `but it does not mean the actions taken steered us correctly on course`. As I see it, **_three_ of _ten_** rights remain; I hope the failing public school systems have got their textbooks up-to-date. Congress has become an incorrect representation of the people, and will continue to be so until the entity not only acknowledges it is bought and sold by lobbyists **\[and corporations paying for those very lobbyists\]**, but also finds itself removing the draperies used to shield its processes. _Seven_ rights, removed:

<p class="img-caption">The Bill of Rights</p>

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Amendment I</p>

<div class="newspaper_snippet">
   <pre class="text">
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Christians have repeatedly taken it upon themselves to [declare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum) this a [nation "Under God"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance).

<img class="inline" src="http://franklovecchio.s3.amazonaws.com/images/frank.lovecch.io/thoughts/revolution-01.jpg"/>
<p class="img-caption">Political blasphemy.</p>

_Even_ the [motto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum) of country was changed to reflect a Christian God via _H.J. Resolution 396_, which completely disregards entire facets of the country by overthrowing `E Pluribus Unum` as our unofficial motto, replacing it with _In God We Trust_. **I do not trust in God, nor do I trust my government**.

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Amendment IV</p>

<div class="newspaper_snippet">
   <pre class="text">
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
  </pre>
</div>

In `2001`, [The Patriot Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) was introduced, allowing searches _without_ warrants, among many things.

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Amendment V</p>

<div class="newspaper_snippet">
   <pre class="text">
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
  </pre>
</div>

In `2012`, amendments to [The National Defense Authorization Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012) canceled out a major portion of this amendment, making all of it a fallacy.

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Amendment VI</p>

<div class="newspaper_snippet">
   <pre class="text">
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.
  </pre>
</div>

In `2012`, amendments to [The National Defense Authorization Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012) removed the right to a "speedy and public trial", thereby voiding this amendment.

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Amendment VII</p>

<div class="newspaper_snippet">
   <pre class="text">
In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Amendment VIII</p>

[Some](http://www.lofgren.house.gov/images/stories/pdf/draft%20lofgren%20bill%20to%20exclude%20terms%20of%20service%20violations%20from%20cfaa%20%20wre%20fraud%20011513.pdf) might say computer crime punishments are a direct violation of this amendment.

Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

<h2>[conclusions]</h2>

The doctrine I have decided appropriate almost seems in some respects like thoughts a young _Howard Roarke_ would have.

1. Ingore man-made obstacles and man-made systems. 

At the root of every parking ticket or spike in hourly parking rate in a city is fiscal mismangaement. At the root of fiscal mismanagement is laziness (and possibly corruption). As I've said before, jobs for people is not a subsitute

we've missed the utopian ideal of place where the only patriotism exists in the form of causes.

This is a place where men - _a single mind_ - is allowed to thrive, where 

I am of the stance that disallowances in freedom of speech sit on the end of a board, while the entire concept resides on the other. Slowly, revisions occur - yelling "fire" in a theatre becomes illegal -

Instead of this nonsense provided by institutions conceived by man, not _a_ man, the truths I found described a place where 


<h2>[i have a dream]</h2>
I too, have dreams; many of them cooincide with Aaron's, as it turns out. `Maybe we're all a litte bit more alike than stereotypes typically convey`. As I stammer my way through the obstacles eventually leading me into **\[or completely away\]** from politics, I am coming to find that m; and chances of `non-violent revolution` become more favored towards the house. Violence and I have never had a true relationship, and my thoughts on it are best described by a post-911 John Stewart:

`[We live in] a country that allows open satire, [which is] why I grieve...but do not despair. They live in chaos, and chaos can't be sustained. Chaos is too easy and too unsatisfying.`

There is a line which must be drawn in the sand. On one side, modern revolution that comes with violence and death. On the side I stand, non-violence exixt - a real use for technology and the people who know how to use it. 

<h2>[an act]</h2>
I am offering a download up a download of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech, which is under copyright. It is not an ideal situation **\[when is it ever?\]**: the file is _not_ hosted on a physical server I own, as I moved to `the cloud` via Amazon Web Services a while ago, and therefor exists in multiple places across their hardware. I fully understand the implications this could hold, though I doubt anyone of stature reads this :)

`Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.
