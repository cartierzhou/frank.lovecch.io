Recently, I had a conversation with a fantastic female presence. She mentioned something about having encountered a man walking on his hands, because he had no legs. Of course, the next logical progression led us to nugget porn, which I can attest does not currently exist in easily attainable form. The conclusion: buy some domain names pertaining to the subject matter and sit on them until nugget porn comes into mainstream. I think more backstory is necessary.<br/>In the Spring of 2008, a plethora of SAE members were hanging out at the university lab. We rarely accomplished anything in those days beyond funny videos on YouTube, and while I don't remember how the conversation started, it ended in an unsuccessful two-hour hunt for nugget porn. As far as I can tell, the only thing in existance is another parked domain, nuggetporn.com. <br/>So, ya know, I got that going for me.
