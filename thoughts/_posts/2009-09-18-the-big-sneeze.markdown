title: the big sneeze.

when: 18 September 2009

My eyes closed themselves instantly. The moment hovered. Then it happened; much like the long-forgotten atomic test explosions in Bikini Atoll, my mouth blasted out squalid mucus membrane into the sweaty, middle section of my left most hand.'Achoo'. I was a loud sneezer, and everyone heard. Most females managed to sound like mice yelling.

'God bless you', she said. I always wondered if hardcore atheists, Pagans, or even non-Christian based religions ever felt any anger towards this gesture, even if in good...faith.

'Gesundheit', he whispered, adjusting his volume for being late. That's more like it - and I don't even like that kid.

'Thanks' blurted from my mouth, in a non-typical, non-condescending tone. My mind averted to a similar situation years previously in middle school. It wasn't just a sneeze that had come, but the rarest-of-rare (and most embarrassing) occasions; a double-decker sneeze and fart combined into one powerful, though odd, noise. My entire algebra 3-4 class erupted with laughter; everyone had felt the vibration and minuscule "toot" sound that wasn't quite drowned out by the sneeze. Our teacher hadn't heard anything abnormal; she was too wrapped up in her TI-83 y-equals-mx-plus-b plots to notice. The occasion had only caused a week's worth of embarrassment, and at the very least, no nicknames had come of it.

I adjusted my peripheral viewing areas on each side to see if anyone was looking for the booger cover up; thankfully the Professor was speaking coherently for once and students were seizing the opportunity to pay attention. He typically spoke so fast his Russian-Chilean accent fouled up seventy-five percent of the consonants and twenty-four percent of the vowels (I once counted). I thought of a plan, and waited a few moments for the dust to settle; just in case some scrupulous student was waiting for the wipe.

It was the ol' itchy nose trick. I brought the goo-retaining hand up to my nose quickly, using the knuckle to fakely quench the itch. From this position I had to briskly decide where the mess would forever reside. There were three options:

One. The underside of my jeans, by my quad. I wouldn't have to be forced to look at the mess all day, and Tide would easily do the cleansing job. Damned, I thought - I just washed these pants. I liked to keep the night on them.

Two. Inside the bottom cuff of my jeans. It was a perfect resting place, but farther from reach. If I could do this while faking an adjustment, it might work. I wasn't sure if I registered "emo" enough to get away with the narcissistic check, though. At least the option was there - at least I threw on pants this morning after my blush induced slumber.

Three. The last option (and last line of defense) was to swipe the boogers on the underside of my desk, or even adjacent to the cover of my textbook - often where grammar schools stamped 'property of'. Choosing the latter would propel the book into a $200 rag, as far as I was concerned. Still, there was one obstacle with this option; material was required to get the final layer of mucus resin off the hand, and a shirt cuff or pant leg would probably have to suffice.

I made my decision just fractions of a second post false itch. As innocently as possible, I brought my boogie hand past the desktop to the bottom portion of my jeans, faked an adjustment, and planted that shit approximately one-half inch from the bottom of my cusp. As I brought my hand back up my head swiveled itself feverishly and exuded the what-are-you-looking-at features most commonly associated with doing something wrong.

My head radar picked up nothing - I was in the clear!
