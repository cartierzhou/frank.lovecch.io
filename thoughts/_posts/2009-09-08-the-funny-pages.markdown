It was during the fall semester of 1995, and I was in fifth grade. For 10 minutes every Tuesday, we were forced to sit quietly and read something of value; the dictators called it 'Sustained Silent Reading', or SSR in short. At this age, mind you, only some of us read. The others, clearly too cool for reading, carved initials into desks (years later, these kids would fail at life). It was also during this time that Scholastic pamphlets were passed out, each copy holding descriptions for the newly released books in our favorite series: Goosebumbs, The Boxcar Children, Animorphs, and probably anything written by Judy Bloom. Mrs. Musial's class, fifth grade, SSR. Got that?

I was parusing through the pamphlet with moderate excitement; you never did know what exciting new series lay ahead. I remember stumbling upon a comic book collection, 'The Days Are Just Packed' - my first happening upon Calvin and Hobbes. It was given good remarks from a fellow classmate, Blake...Blake...it's amazing how I can't remember his last name for the life of me. He was in my Cub Scout pack years before, and by now he had become relatively "cool" for a fifth grader - he was dating a brunette hottie from the sixth grade, if I do recall correctly ;) Anyways...

In those days my parents did the physical purchasing, and any book from the pamphlet which I circled in red usually got the green light. They never asked any questions or filtered content, so at least I had that going for me. I recall going through 'The Days Are Just Packed' very quickly. Not so coincidentally, I started reading the comics in the morning paper, and thus my love affair with Calvin and Hobbes began. 

The last strip of Calvin and Hobbes was published on December 31st, 1995 - six days after I received a few new Calvin and Hobbes collections for Christmas: 'Homicidal, Physco Jungle Cat', 'Revenge of the Baby-Sat', and 'The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'. I was just months into our relationship and Bill Watterson had cut it short, blimey! I remember reading that last strip, unofficially titled 'It's a Magical World', and getting watery (I was a sap back then, too).

As I read my way through all the collections over the course of the next few years, I also read and re-read every Foreword and bit of information Mr. Watterson had to share, thus giving me and the like insight into his mind and actions. I also found myself taking up other comic collections: The Far Side and Foxtrot were the the only ones which still remain in my Rob Gordon 'Top Five' list.

This morning I sat in a Holiday Inn (that I am not staying at) and munched on complimentary breakfast. They have free copies of the morning post sitting out, and I picked up one purely out of old habit. While I already read most of the news (thanks to a thing called the Internet/Digg), I turned my way to the comics section...

Page Forty-Eight

Page 48 of The Pueblo Chieftan is taken up mostly by eighteen three-paned black and white comic strips, while a crossword puzzle and a 'Celebrity Cipher' take up the other smidge. I imagine if this were a Sunday Edition the comics would be in separate section, but from what I understand, this is a dying fad. The comics that appear on page 48 are mostly the same as the ones present in the Tribune or Herald: Dennis the Menace, Family Circus, Beetle Bailey, Blondie, Garfield, BC, Peanuts (Classic), Rose is Rose, Born Loser, Frank and Ernest, Baby Blues, Pickles, Rex Morgan, Sherman's Lagoon, Get Fuzzy, and Zits. Notably missing from page 48, but usually included in the Chicago papers, are: For Better or for Worse, Mr. Boffo, Doonesbury, Foxtrot, Cathy, Brenda Starr, and Non-Sequitur.

Once in a great while I will read the Sunday Comics, only to be disappointed time-and-time again. This process repeats itself; I always forget how dismal the comic scene has become, on paper at least. While I also believe the newspaper is a dying breed (in modernized, affluent countries), the daily comics - affectionately known as 'The Funny Pages' to the past generation - are dead.

Major strips I can tolerate (with emphasis):

Peanuts
Charles Schulz seemed to embrace commercialization, and it worked. I remember the Peanuts crew more for their animated films than the comic strip. The paper version lacks, except for Snoopy. To think that 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' aired in 1965 is odd, its utter simplicity and quotability ('All I want is what I have coming to me, all I want is my fair share!') has attributed to its belovedness, at least for my sister and I (or me?). 

Non-Sequitur
While I haven't followed this strip in a while, I did enjoy the Sunday edition - which is all the local newspapers seem to pick up. It had an interesting story line and took up plot lines with more religious and political overtones. 

Brenda Starr
The only thing I enjoyed about this strip was the art. It reminded me of the antiquated noir-style comics, but didn't suck me in as much. It might have been what Dick Tracy looked like before becoming a cartoony parody of itself. 

Garfield
Another point for the animated series. The comic strip is terrible, the movies were worse, but the cartoon we grew up on was a decent kid's show - at least when the farm animals were onscreen.

Mr. BoffoEvery strip starts out with a single frame and depicts odd words on Mr. Boffo's shirt. Once in a while, it surprised me. Other times, I was clueless.

For Better or for Worse
Clearly written by an over-sentimental woman, I enjoyed the strip when it was more subtle in its endeavor to win your heart. Other than that, it was boring.

The Digital Age
If you have taken the time to read (and re-read) the Calvin and Hobbes collections, you may agree with me when I say this: I never thought I would find a modern day substitute. Greatness was achieved through a combination of remarkable words (some of which I still don't understand) and interesting, original art. So much has been said about Bill Watterson's strip already, but I will say - once more with feeling - it is undoubtedly my favorite comic strip, ever. Clearly I am not the only one who feels this way, as my second strip on the 'Top Five' list, XKCD, was influenced heavily by Calvin and Hobbes.

I forget who turned me on to the strip, but it was during my employment with the UIC ACCC (you know, the computer people). If I had to guess, it was either Indelli or Hef; and if you know them, that wouldn't be a surprise. It was not as popular (or Dugg) back then, but while clicking through the entire series of a couple hundred strips, I became emotionally attached watching the strip evolve - much like going through the Calvin and Hobbes strips from start to finish. I have always enjoyed watching something tangible, mine or not, evolve over years. I would probably equate this with the Amelie-esque 'like/dislike' monologues, where a narrator (and often the character themselves) depicts the things they enjoy and abhor in random sequences. For instance, Amelie enjoyed guessing how many couples were having orgasms at that very moment.

It was XKCD alone that brought me into the digital age of comics. I think Bill Watterson once made a comment about a strip either having to be greatly illustrated or greatly worded to succeed, and XKCD fits into the latter category - but with heart. My math/computer/engineering background definitely helped in enjoying (and understanding) the strip; as a result, I was able to laugh out loud - and feel emotion - towards those god-awful stick characters. XKCD has directly parodied Cavlin and Hobbes in a few strips, but mostly it just blatantly puts out there what most of us are thinking (or at least myself, anyways), and this makes it quite amusing most of the time (velociraptor attack!).

I guess Sean Connery had it right when he said 'never say never'. Thanks to XKCD (and Cyanide and Happiness), a hole has been filled in my daily comic strip world. I doubt I will drop the habit of reading the comic section, because in the end - there's always hope - even if just for a better comic.
