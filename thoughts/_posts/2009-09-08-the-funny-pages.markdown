The year _1995_; the grade - _fifth_. For _ten_ minutes every Tuesday, we were forced to sit quietly and read something substantial; the dictators called it `Sustained Silent Reading`, SSR for short. At this point in our adolescence, _especially being enrolled in a public school_, only _some_ of us read. The others, _strung_ out on pubescant emotion and dealing with an inner monologue full of bad-to-no parenting, carved initials into desks with protractors, coloring the grooves with washable _Crayolas_ for enhancement. Tuesday, _bloody_ Tuesday. 

<h2>[scholastic book club]</h2>
Once a month, during this same segment in our day, the new _Scholastic Book Club_ pamphlets were issued to us. It was thrilling! I gaily remember anticipating a new realease from series like Goosebumbs, The Boxcar Children, and Animorphs. `You are never too old for The Boxcar Children`.

I remember flipping through the releases avidly; one never did know what exciting new series would be found printed on the _ninenty-nine_ percent recycled pages. Then, one day, I stumbled upon [The Days Are Just Packed](http://www.amazon.com/Days-are-Just-Packed-Collection/dp/0836217357); a child's first encounter with [Calvin and Hobbes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes). It was given good remarks from a fellow classmate, Blake Edwards **\[who also happened to be dating an older brunette vixen from the _sixth_ grade, lending his remarks more stature than should have been given precidence\]**.

The books were quick to rummage through if one did not research definitions of half the words in any bubble **\[being a youth, my goal was not to learn with any help from myself\]**. Not so coincidentally, I took up reading the comics in the morning paper; my love affair with the strip had begun.

<p class="img-caption">It sure is.</p>

The last strip of Calvin and Hobbes was published on December _thirty-first_, _1995_ - six days after I received a few new Calvin and Hobbes collections for Christmas: 'Homicidal, Physco Jungle Cat', 'Revenge of the Baby-Sat', and 'The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'. I was just months into our relationship and Bill Watterson had cut it short, blimey! I remember reading that last strip, unofficially titled 'It's a Magical World', and getting watery (I was a sap back then, too).

As I read my way through all the collections over the course of the next few years, I also read and re-read every Foreword and bit of information Mr. Watterson had to share, thus giving me and the like insight into his mind and actions. I also found myself taking up other comic collections: The Far Side and Foxtrot were the the only ones which still remain in my Rob Gordon 'Top Five' list.

This morning I sat in a Holiday Inn (that I am not staying at) and munched on complimentary breakfast. They have free copies of the morning post sitting out, and I picked up one purely out of old habit. While I already read most of the news (thanks to a thing called the Internet/Digg), I turned my way to the comics section...

<h2>[page forty-eight]</h2>
Page 48 of The Pueblo Chieftan is taken up mostly by eighteen three-paned black and white comic strips, while a crossword puzzle and a 'Celebrity Cipher' take up the other smidge. I imagine if this were a Sunday Edition the comics would be in separate section, but from what I understand, this is a dying fad. The comics that appear on page 48 are mostly the same as the ones present in the Tribune or Herald: Dennis the Menace, Family Circus, Beetle Bailey, Blondie, Garfield, BC, Peanuts (Classic), Rose is Rose, Born Loser, Frank and Ernest, Baby Blues, Pickles, Rex Morgan, Sherman's Lagoon, Get Fuzzy, and Zits. Notably missing from page 48, but usually included in the Chicago papers, are: For Better or for Worse, Mr. Boffo, Doonesbury, Foxtrot, Cathy, Brenda Starr, and Non-Sequitur.

Once in a great while I will read the Sunday Comics, only to be disappointed time-and-time again. This process repeats itself; I always forget how dismal the comic scene has become, on paper at least. While I also believe the newspaper is a dying breed (in modernized, affluent countries), the daily comics - affectionately known as 'The Funny Pages' to the past generation - are dead.


<h2>[a sorry second]</h2>
Peanuts
Charles Schulz seemed to embrace commercialization, and it worked. I remember the Peanuts crew more for their animated films than the comic strip. The paper version lacks, except for Snoopy. To think that 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' aired in 1965 is odd, its utter simplicity and quotability ('All I want is what I have coming to me, all I want is my fair share!') has attributed to its belovedness, at least for my sister and I (or me?). 

Non-Sequitur
While I haven't followed this strip in a while, I did enjoy the Sunday edition - which is all the local newspapers seem to pick up. It had an interesting story line and took up plot lines with more religious and political overtones. 

Brenda Starr
The only thing I enjoyed about this strip was the art. It reminded me of the antiquated noir-style comics, but didn't suck me in as much. It might have been what Dick Tracy looked like before becoming a cartoony parody of itself. 

Garfield
Another point for the animated series. The comic strip is terrible, the movies were worse, but the cartoon we grew up on was a decent kid's show - at least when the farm animals were onscreen.

Mr. BoffoEvery strip starts out with a single frame and depicts odd words on Mr. Boffo's shirt. Once in a while, it surprised me. Other times, I was clueless.

For Better or for Worse
Clearly written by an over-sentimental woman, I enjoyed the strip when it was more subtle in its endeavor to win your heart. Other than that, it was boring.

<h2>[digitalism]</h2>
If you have taken the time to read (and re-read) the Calvin and Hobbes collections, you may agree with me when I say this: I never thought I would find a modern day substitute. Greatness was achieved through a combination of remarkable words (some of which I still don't understand) and interesting, original art. So much has been said about Bill Watterson's strip already, but I will say - once more with feeling - it is undoubtedly my favorite comic strip, ever. Clearly I am not the only one who feels this way, as my second strip on the 'Top Five' list, XKCD, was influenced heavily by Calvin and Hobbes.

I forget who turned me on to the strip, but it was during my employment with the UIC ACCC (you know, the computer people). If I had to guess, it was either Indelli or Hef; and if you know them, that wouldn't be a surprise. It was not as popular (or Dugg) back then, but while clicking through the entire series of a couple hundred strips, I became emotionally attached watching the strip evolve - much like going through the Calvin and Hobbes strips from start to finish. I have always enjoyed watching something tangible, mine or not, evolve over years. I would probably equate this with the Amelie-esque 'like/dislike' monologues, where a narrator (and often the character themselves) depicts the things they enjoy and abhor in random sequences. For instance, Amelie enjoyed guessing how many couples were having orgasms at that very moment.

It was XKCD alone that brought me into the digital age of comics. I think Bill Watterson once made a comment about a strip either having to be greatly illustrated or greatly worded to succeed, and XKCD fits into the latter category - but with heart. My math/computer/engineering background definitely helped in enjoying (and understanding) the strip; as a result, I was able to laugh out loud - and feel emotion - towards those god-awful stick characters. XKCD has directly parodied Cavlin and Hobbes in a few strips, but mostly it just blatantly puts out there what most of us are thinking (or at least myself, anyways), and this makes it quite amusing most of the time (velociraptor attack!).

I guess Sean Connery had it right when he said 'never say never'. Thanks to XKCD (and Cyanide and Happiness), a hole has been filled in my daily comic strip world. I doubt I will drop the habit of reading the comic section, because in the end - there's always hope - even if just for a better comic.
