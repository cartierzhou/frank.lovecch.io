If I died tomorrow, I would wish that every person who inspired me receive an explanatory letter. I started with the book dedication above, and I continue here.

Originally, I thought I would post a comment on one of your blogs, but it seemed to impersonal for something which had affected me so much. I've been on this near quarter-life rant lately regarding thanking my inspirations (of which you're the second), so I'm glad I waited for the right words to assemble in my head. I first stumbled upon thesartorialist after a fashonista friend updated her websites on Facebook. What struck me initially, and what shines through - besides fashion and lifestyle - is your passion, and that is one very important element which will always attract me to people, to ideas, and yes - to blogs! This passion oozes out of your words, even through one-sentence, pictorial descriptions at a time.

The 'grace and manner's postings, which came somewhere back in February (I think), instigated a defining moment of sorts. I had always loathed rudeness, and generally tried to be a charismatic, well-mannered individual (especially towards strangers), but the mantra became embedded into my head post-blog reading.

I was on a date recently (with one of the most ambitious and intelligent women I've ever met), and she managed to cut the top of her toe on the under-side of the table. Without thinking (what I consider to be the true judge of a person's attributes), I jumped up and asked one of the restaurant employees for a band aid, then grabbed some napkins. I'm not anywhere close to the man I want to embody, but at least I'll know when I get there. 

Thanks for the inspiration,
Frank LoVecchio
