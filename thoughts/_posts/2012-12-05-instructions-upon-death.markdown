I will die. In the event that I die:

<h2>[obituary]</h2>
I don't want my obituary to read dully. I was hoping that a group of my friends and loved ones might get together **\[any that might wish to volunteer\]**, along with someone who actually knows how to write, and hash something out. If they are not capable of producing something of caliber, I should like it to read:

`He had passion, and misses the bad as greatly as the good.`

<h2>[funeral]</h2>
1. Cremate me. 

I'd hope you put the ashes in a [vintage metal tin](http://esmeraldasquietlife.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/amelie-2.jpg) that bears some semblance to the one in that movie with the traveling gnome. Please bury that tin under the nearest Joshua tree to the cabin in San Luis Valley. Make a trip of it.

1. Don't hold it at the Bartlett Funeral Home, for Heaven's sake. If it's warm, I'd prefer an outdoor party at my parent's house filled with many libations **\[that's booze, parents\]** , music I would have liked, and good food. None of that bland crap, mom. 

<h2>[assets]</h2>

1. Money

I probably won't have any. In any case, give it all to my sister. If there's an abundance of it, she'll know how to distribute it between the people I love.

1. Cars

Hopefully I will outlive my parents, but in the case that I don't, Frank **\[Paul\]** LoVecchio - my father - should do what he pleases with the `1948 CJ2A Willy's`, `1980 Z28 Camaro`, `1993 Jeep Wrangler`, `2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited`, and whatever exists of the `1928 Model A Ford`, which is really a `1932 Coupe`, but it's just titled as the former. It's kind of legal. 

I'd hope the Camaro makes it to the funeral, leaks and all.

1. Patents

I probably won't have any. In any case, give their rights to Brian Shanks, he's an engineer - he'll be able to figure it out.

1. Digital 

Technically, I have digital assets - music, films, code, documents, etc. I gift these to my family, in hopes my sister can get one of my computer-nerd friends to help her through deciphering getting them.

All of my account passwords exist as a hard-file on my Mac laptop in the "Notes" app, under a list called "Accounts". `There are no backups, this is the only copy.` The password to my Mac **\[which doesn't relate to any of my account passwords\]** is `isidorey`. Since you will have access to all of my accounts, you will also need to know what they entail...another time, maybe.

1. Walden Ranch

It's not worth anything, but I'd like it to be taken care of for all my loved ones to use as an escape. It will require maintenance, but hopefully you can get together and manage this. 

<h2>[social]</h2>

1. Facebook/Twitter

If they're still around, please post one last status as `Cheers to the dash, I love you all`.
