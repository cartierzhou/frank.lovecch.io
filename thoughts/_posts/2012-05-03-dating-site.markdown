When I was in college, I posted on Craigslist. Nothing dirty <b>[that I'll admit?]</b>, just a <i>boy seeks girl</i> kind of thing. And I met a pretty girl. She was nice, but I didn't feel any romantic connection <b>[and she didn't drink...at all]</b>. We became partial friends, but it never stuck. Fast-forward four years; I'm new to Colorado, unemployed, living in a garage, and had no contacts under forty years of age. It was an interesting time. I had nothing better to do but join a real dating website. And I used Starbucks wi-fi to do it. It was rather hard to be inconspicuous about parusing babes in a well-traveled coffeeshop, but I think my tiny ten-inch netbook helped with that. I got a monthly subscription to <a href="">match.com</a> for free, presumably because I clicked on an ad they only show to lonely, horny, broke twenty-four year olds. And I went out on one single date with a remarkable woman. Older, vibrant, beautiful. A scar on her cheek that gave her character. Obviously, I fell in love and lied about the the garage: `I was renting a room from a guy in Wash Park`. I may have even written her a tiny love letter about her giving me hope and such <b>[fucking sap]</b>. And then I got a job, and she blew me off. Go figure.

The moral of the story? What follows below is how you writing a dating site profile.

<h1>On How to Write a Profile</h1>

In 160 characters or less (stolen from my Twitter):
"modern-day grifter, digital business empowerer, tinkerer, vintage auto enthusiast, api masherer, android developer, and at my roots: a self-taught lifehacker."

The short: I'm a sentimentalist; we're all in this together.

The medium: I find it difficult to find someone who is a worthwhile companion; it seems the lasting relationships we tend to make (as we get older) are actually less withstanding than the ones we formed in childhood (or as early, collegiate adults), and I'm hoping to find someone willing to break that stereotype.

The long: I would love to meet a cohort, a counterpoint, and a copilot. I love outgoing, intelligent, and naturally attractive spitfires who don't mind an out-of-the box gent like myself.

I am plethorally ambitious, and like to surround myself with people of the same persona. I long for a life that doesn't involve plain-boxed suburbs, cynicism, and parking tickets. I celebrate my great failures even more so than my small successes (with wine, no-less) - always striving for greatness in everything I do.

I keep myself busy with constant projects, but would really enjoy another creative soul in my life - someone to push my boundaries in thought and activity - the Patti Smith to my Robert Mapplethorpe (aside from his sexual predisposition to males). To quote a more known simile, the Allie to my Noah (if you're a bird, I'm a bird, and all that gushy stuff).

The interests: I restore, build, and create things - whether it be the digital or physical. I like oddness in all forms, and really want to attend a midnight showing of something at The Esquire. I consider fragments of myself embedded in previous generations, but my mind seems to run in current mode. I'm fairly active, and Colorado continues to throw new things at me - I enjoy sports, but rarely watch them (save Blackhawks).

The realistic: I'm looking for someone who is open-minded, considers laying under the stars and drinking wine an intimate date, and is the definable opposite of a negative-nancy. Some wit and learnedness would also be appreciated :) Ideally, I'll find a relationship that rivals: <a href="">http://www.brintonfilms.com/lex-loren-engagementsave-the-date</a>.
