A **\[continuously evolving\]** series of letters to the woman, and from the woman, who inspires me, inspired in part by [Letters of Note](http://lettersofnote.com). I will replace her inquiries with paraphrasing. I should probably ask her permission to republish some of these thoughts, but nobody reads this anyways :)

<h2>[to hannah: december 2, 2012]</h2>
I received a series of angst-ridden texts questioning the doldrums of society.

I've been thinking about some positive aspects of repetition in response to your SMS musings.

Studies have been undertaken that ask the question, "How does one become a master at something?". The answer is generally accepted to be somewhere around the equivalent of 5,000 hours of nothing other than...repetition...in one's area of to-be expertise. For me, this reiteration - in most cases - also correlates with productivity. And those combined equal mastery.

While the above seems relatively simplistic by definition, there are a few caveats:

The spark

I've found that when I'm "in the zone" (a transcendental work mode? Jim McMahon, 1985 Bears QB of all people, described this best, but I can't remember how), new ideas come forth and are born out of making the motions easier. Humans are constantly creating, perfecting, or destroying systems. 

The burnout

Too much repetitiveness causes extreme languish and dissipates simpler joys, as the mind is overwhelmed with angst. 

When I introduce freshness in my life - a new food at the grocery store, a visit to a cafe I haven't been, or even a system uprising (trying this way as opposed to that) - burnout is kept at bay.

I call it "The Renaissance Me", and this way, I am always gaslighting my mind into perceiving it's moving forward, even if not physically.

We were going back and forth about traveling to Europe, and it spiraled into this observation.

<div class="snippet">
   <pre class="text">
Essentially, American culture values perfection. Take a look at any magazine. The French, however, value uniqueness, even if that means flaws or imperfections. A recent French actress straightened a front tooth of hers, which was considered very "unchic" or "unfrench." I had many comments while I was over there about my "perfect, white American" teeth, and they are right. As I was over there longer, it became easier to pick out an American from a mile away. Bad makeup job, too much eyeliner, jeans and a t-sshirt, hair manipulated by their good friend the flat iron. Another French actress said, "The most beautiful makeup a woman can wear is passion." Spot on :)

They also value aging! Older women are considered more wise, but also more sensual and in touch with their feminine nature. French women always contain some sort of existential mystery. They don't work out, yet stay attractively slim (hallelujah, if nothing else, I want to be like the french in this regard.) Muscle is unfeminine. They walk everywhere and eat real food. Not reduced calorie snackbars, or sugar free nonfat lattes ;). "Un cafe, s'il vous plait".

Natural. Classy. Timeless. I love the French :). Albeit their snobby attitudes.

<h2>[to hannah: november 27, 2012]</h2>

I received a passionate e-mail regarding Hannah's constant fight battle with religion. She grew up in the bible belt, and receives continuous opposing influence to the things she's coming to believe.

<div class="snippet">
   <pre class="text">
My parents were married in a non-denominational church in the 1970's because their ancestral religious practices clashed; my father Catholic, my mother New Apostolic. My very existence is based on religious discordance, a fact which has never escaped me. 

Throughout my life, I've attended various religious ceremonies, most of which were based around sects of the Christian faith. On joyous and dark terms, in birth, marriage, and death. My presence at these ceremonies was never due to religious practice, but out of Love for family or friends. Always an outsider, I found it difficult to be respectful of tradition and not actively participate in practices I didn't believe in (or was not fully aware of). I was present none-the-less.

Love is not a religious concept, nor is it a Christian concept. You know this. Love, my dear Hannah, is a human condition! Love! It continuously inspires me in all its forms (tangent: you must now stay awake to watch Love Actually). It fills us up and tears us down and we revel in agony and glory in the opposite. The Buddhists actually believe Love to be selfish. To hell with that, I say! Fulfillment by Love is transitive, in that it is recognized and gathered by others in surrounding. 

We all have emotional damage wrought. I am no-less broken.

"All of our parents did considerable emotional damage. As a matter of fact, I'm told it's one of the best parts of being a parent." 
- Scrubs

While your character - both its wonder and chips - will be a part of me loving you, there will also be an abundance of other factors. Your ability to write this quasi-rant is one of them.

"I think I love you, Cal."
"I'm not good."
"Because you're not good."
- East of Eden

We all seek a God, Hannah, even myself.

"Angel-headed hipster burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of the night."

Most give up rather easily, though, and accept the beliefs imparted on them simply by virtue of being born into a particular family in a particular region. To think! The more I seek God, the more I find myself divided. Organized religion, like any man-made system, is flawed. All systems in the universe are, in fact (entropy). Religious practice should not come at a cost to our pocketbooks, or with a hatred for another person or group of people. Because those things exist, I really want you to ask yourself why you're terrified of not claiming the Christian faith.

Are you worried about lacking moral fiber, or just being judged negatively by those close to you? The loved ones in your life should not berate you for happiness in any form. Negativity is the quickest killer of the human spirit and mind, and should be eradicated with kindness, compassion, and logic as quickly as possible.

"I do not believe that a man should be restrained in his daily actions by being afraid of punishment after death or that he should do things only because in this way he will be rewarded after he dies. This does not make sense. The proper guidance during the life of a man should be the weight that he puts upon ethics and the amount of consideration that he has for others."
- Albert Einstein

We both have the burden of being thinkers, and occasionally, our minds interfere with our perception of things we can not describe. Nor can we even fathom our inability to describe the things we can not describe! Justification is for sissies. Sometimes, things just are. I am strongly aware of the human condition to try, though, and this is the essence of your quest to seek truth and meaning. 

"And what I was looking for was not to be found, but to be made."
- John Hughes

When you are haunted by thoughts of Christianity being the only virtuous way, thing of how our modern lives came to be shaped. All of the rights we have in this country, at least politically, are available to us because a group of people (most luckily) managed to seek a place free from religious persecution. While this is not exactly your problem, you can see how one would draw similarities, and begin to ask questions. I can't stay whether the issues are directly related to religion, people, or the combination, but I know that the world is not black and white.

The descendants of the religiously persecuted, then, would be the founding fathers of the country.

"Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between church and State."
- Thomas Jefferson

If you find a God, let it be on your own terms. Listen to others, learn from others, but don't let the pulp of the masses sway your viewpoint face-value, especially if what's preached has been. When things feel right, most of the time, well, they are :)

<h2>[to hannah: november 11, 2012]</h2>

The letter I wrote in response to my feelings. Since it changed as I transposed into non-digital, paper form **\[hers being the only particular copy in existence\]**, this draft will have to do. I don't think it as eloquent, but there's some biased romanticism at work here.

Dearest Hannah,

At the very beginning of this year, I made a simple New Year's Resolution to "Be Better". I had a proclivity for failure near the beginning; this was to be expected. I now attribute that struggle to my ongoing fight with the energies at be, and for explanation, have recently pondered the Overview Effect: a quantifiable notion of _small_ which all astronauts reported having felt upon return from space. Jim Lovell said it best: "Just from the distance of the Moon, you can put your thumb up, and you can hide the Earth behind your thumb. Everything that you have ever known, your loved ones, your business, the problems of the Earth itself, all behind your thumb. How insignificant we really all are". 

Somewhere in my quest for fortune and glory - a modern, Alexander-the-Great attempt to conquer feeling _small_ - I let slip from my mind the inspirations to my aspirations. The good stuff. Our relationship represents one of the atrocities committed by me during that Custard-like charge on the universe.

It has become remarkably clear I want you in my life. If not obvious, the qualities attributed to your persona, and your demonstrable ability to feel - feel! - attract me in a way words wouldn't even begin to try imparting their definitions for proper description, fearing failure themselves. I believe this feeling to be recurrent, not seasonal, and since it is easy for me to denote we are the kind of people whom leap, not step, I am full-heartedly proposing an idea in which the majority might think rogue and ill conceived. It's not. I ask you, Hannah, my equivalent, to give a monogamous relationship with me a chance - here, in Denver. Playing together, being openly communicative, compassionate, and expressing ourselves through physical interaction and gentility...that's really all there would be to it, the rest following suit.

Now, I am not ignorant to how relationships work, nor the different entry points into them in which trust is established, then exists. At first it is willed, gifted even, but after that, earned. If you should find it in your heart to not only forgive me, but to see things others can't, I promise to befriend, learn from, travel with, and than love - you - in such a way that we would be both independent and inseparable. Dual. What I seek is a combination of both a respect for and an adoration of; something possible now, but not in our initial conception.

Conclusion comes with gravitas, but little expectation, as do I understand the implications of our history would normally entail the juxtaposition of your hand and my face. Whatever your decision, there will always be a place in my world for you.

Frank 

P.S.

Logistically, my thoughts come to this: "Don't worry about losing. If it is right, it happens - The main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away." I can appreciate that we are two people doing two different things, but happiness shared is noticeably greater and fulfilling. In plain-speak, I understand your gathering-up of the world, through travel, in coming to be as a person. All the greats do this in one form or another. I have limited my long-destined travels for reasons which most may not understand - in creating, I explore new worlds often. I am here, but always somewhere else. This is both productive and not, and I do realize some more lifestyle changes are necessary, but only if there is a middle-ground; I quite like the sound of that place.

P.P.S.

Sometimes, when ya know, ya just know.
