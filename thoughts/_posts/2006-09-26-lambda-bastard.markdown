It's 9:30 PM Central Standard Time. I'm taking a nap after waking up at 5 AM for hockey practice and two jobs. My alarm is set to 10:15 PM so I can wake up and study for my upcoming Vibrations test. In walks Eric Grebliunas, the man who forgot to bring the hockey pucks to practice, the man whose car keys were on my desk, the man who voraciously sabatoged my sleep/study plan. 'Wake up, we're working out,' is what he says to my half-enabled mind after taking my pillow. 'Umgfeeghhs... no, I have to study,' says I. Then he proceeded to throw objects at my crotch. Lluckily for me, I figured this would happen, and had already formed a protective 'hand cup' over my penis. Then the poking started, followed by some blanket stealing. Too far my friend, too far. Lucky for him, I was in a coma, otherwise I would've been a contenda. I got a few punches in, though, and after about 15 minutes of assholeism, he gave up. Assbag.
