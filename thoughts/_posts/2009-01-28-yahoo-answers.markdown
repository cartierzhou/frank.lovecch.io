When Google, Wikipedia, Digg, and real people fail to answer a question I have, I turn to Yahoo Answers. By now, we should alll know about the 'anonymous internet fucktard rule'. If you don't, go here first -> http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/10/08/youtube-audio-preview/.

Actually, you should probably go there anyways, and make sure to read the comic! (don't forget the hover)

Great, that's settled. After asking a few questions here and there on Yahoo Answers, I began to find that nearly 3 out of 4 answers I received were created by opinionated morons who knew nothing about what I was asking. The responders also failed to answer in a way that showed they read AND understood the question! I brushed it off, partially because there was always 1 solid answer that helped me (at least a little bit), and partially because I saw how much these people were answering questions - they're called power users. If you have read anything about the Digg/Reddit battle, you'll see that the power user phenomenon has become highly followed, and highly fought about; but let's save that battle for another note.

Today I asked a question regarding speedometers (I would, wouldn't I?):


Speedometer Swap on a 1995 Civic EX?

I ripped the stock gauge cluster out and replaced all of instruments except for the digital speedometer. I want something large (think Mini Cooper style), does any company sell a 5 inch + digital programmable speedometer that isn't ridiculously expensive? (less than $300) The largest I can seem to find is a 5 inch diameter, and the Mini's is definitely bigger than that.


I figured that since the Mini speedometer was so highly regarded, something like it had to have been reproduced. I couldn't find it for the life of me on the internet, but that happens a lot with car parts.

Here is the very genuine answer that "Seth G" replied to me:
all i have to say is that you arent going to get **** when you sell that car

Yahoo softly asks you to quote your sources and/or knowledge base regarding the question when replying. Here is what "Seth G" quoted as his source:

Source(s):ricer

Oh Sethy boy, how wrong you are! I kindly replied something about not ever mentioning selling my car and called him a Paul Walker wannabe....the rest is best left to your imagination :)

In the process of poking around the website, I discovered the 'Answer' section of Yahoo...Answers. I had only asked questions before, and it never occurred to me to answer any until today! I found out there is a points system in place for answering and asking questions, and you'll never guess who has the most points...power users! I read some of the questions in the computers and transportation category, my most noteworthy fields, and decided to actually answer these peoples questions.



The question I came across just happened to be a subject of which I was quite knowledgeable:
School filter, How to get past?

I've been trying to get past the school block cause i have to stay after school about a hour and half and finish all my homework get A's but its boring the last hour cause my friends leave after that i've heard of using firefox so installed the portable version on my flash drive but it didn't let me through the blocker so if anyone knows how to get past the filter without using proxy servers thanks

Aside from this kids terrible fucking English, I really got a kick out of some of the so-called answers:



Answer 1)

No ways should work.



School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.

Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.

All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.

Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist.

You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.

Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.

Answer 2)

Circumventing or Hacking your School firewall is illegal a violation of your school usage polices it's also violation of YA community rules to post questions that break the law or help others do it please take time to review the guidelines thank you!

There are more, but you get the idea! Obviously the kid probably had some server side firewall to go against, probably a 'Websense' type thing, and it's very possible to use a proxy server to get to sites that it blocks...I do it at work all the time (Facebook, cough)...I just didn't know why the kid hadn't used Yahoo Answers to ask for proxy server sites that were fresh (as in not blocked by the system yet). Anyways, answer number 1 was written by a power user (go figure!), so I felt compelled to hack the planet a bit.

My answer:

What have you got against proxy servers? They work great! Otherwise, try installing the TOR and FoxyProxy add-ons for Firefox, if the ports aren't blocked, then they should work for anonymous browsing. I have a server-side firewall (websense) where I work, and I use proxy servers to get onto Facebook, etc.



Oh, and tell those ninnies above to stop following the rules. Really people?



In retrospect, I should have told him to go to a fresh proxy site like xamal.org or payday2007.com, but at least I attempted to answer his fucking question.

Yahoo Answers? No, not really. More like Yahoo Opinions (mostly written by assholes with bad grammar).
