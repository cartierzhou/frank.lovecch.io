The automobile, and what it means to me:

If I had to recall a single defining moment in time when I became a 'car guy', it would be April 9th, 2001. On account of good grades and nerdy behavior, my parents early birthday gift to me, three whole months early, was an unloved, barely-running, multi-colored 1980 Z28 Camaro.  We found it in a classifieds ad for three-thousand, five-hundred dollars. It had been sitting outside for years in the charming Northwest Suburbs of Chicago; an abandoned project, a typical story.  The body's original color looked to be 'Loser Blue'; the interior faded, cracked. The owner managed to get it running before he sold it to us, a premise my dad had insisted upon.  

We drove it home in the rain on bald tires and fading accessories, the alternator had blown before we even left the original owner's driveway.  The massive giant barely rolled onto our own strip of pavement, content to have stretched her legs for the time being.  I basked in our won battle, unofficially joining a dying clique of muscle-heads (whom I would eventually differentiate myself from).

Over the course of the next three months, I did my best to help my father with the body work, disassembly, and paint prepping.   My father's method of teaching, looking back, explains a lot about why I dive into things the way I do.  He would show me how to do something, but not explain how to do it or why it worked.  Only when I was on the brink of making more work for him did a full-page synopsis get released.  

July 16th, 2001 - my golden birthday, the day I became a man, the day I gained freedom - was a hectic day.  My father, myself, and a friend of mine spent many hours attaching the Z28 ground effects that 'make' the lines of those years, along with general other driveablity concerns - fluids, lights, carb adjustments, etc.  The Z didn't have many of its defining features at the time - the stripe kit, the BF Goodrich Radial T/A's, and the eventual attempt at polished aluminum rims - but it looked sharp with fresh paint and clean lines (my father is a true artist).  My friend and I left the driveway in the early evening, headed for my first fill-up.  I remember accidentally hitting the horn, finding out it worked, and giggling.  The feeling that ran through my veins is the same one I get every time I finish one of my car projects, pure adrenaline mixed with the warm fuzzies.   

Driving a vintage car is just like being in an exclusive club.  Heads turn, people stare, and windows roll down for inquiries.
	
'Is that an '81? (usually they're a year off, presumably the fish-gill louvres are not a good enough indication)

Oh, it's an '80?  I used to have one just like it.  Probably getting about 10 miles to the gallon, eh?'</i></p>

At this point, the left arrow usually turns green, and it's time to wrap up the conversation.  

'Well, it's in good shape.  You don't see many driving that are in decent shape, anymore.'

I typically respond with a non-giddy thanks, but we all know that's just a cover.
