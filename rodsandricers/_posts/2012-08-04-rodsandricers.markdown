If you've never sat in an unrestored vintage automobile and `inhaled deeply that tinted must`, my heart pains for you.

When does one become synonymous with the term `car guy`, and is that term somehow indicative of `muscle head`? **\[I surely hope not\]**. If I had to recall the single defining moment in which the former term became a representation of me, I think I would declare it to be `April Ninth, Two-Thousand and One`. On account of good grades and generally nerdy, well-fashioned behavior, my parents early birthday gift to my _fifteen_ year-old self was an unloved, multi-colored _Nineteen-Eighty_ Z28 Camaro. We found the antiquated Pony-car in a classifieds ad for the striking deal of _three-thousand, five-hundred_ dollars. It had been sitting outside in a charming Northwest Suburb of Chicago for years; `an abandoned project, a typical story`. The original color looked to be what the old-boys described as `Loser Blue`; the interior was faded, cracked, and contained seats barely bolted down **\[which always provoked my father to tell the story of how he drove his GTO around sitting on a milk crate\]**. With lightning striking in the background, the seller managed to get it running before we signed the papers, a premise my dad had insisted upon.

We drove the `galloping beast` home through the rain on bald tires and fading accessories; the alternator had blown before we had even left on our journey. Barely rolling onto our own strip of pavement, a feeling of contentment had arrived over my father and I - for now, we were happy to have stretched the legs of the newest addition to the family. `I basked in our won battle`.

Over the course of that next _three_ months, I did my best to help with body work, disassembly, and paint prep. The method of teaching I was accustomed to did not fare well with my father, as he had his own opinions on learning, best described as `Do this until I tell you you're doing it wrong`. Never receiving the full lesson initially, I always had to dive in, gathering context only on what could be derived from the act. A full-page synopsis was always released, but rarely did it not coincide with dancing near the brink of creating more work for everyone involved **\[looking back, this explains a lot about why I dive into things the way I do\]**. 

`July Sixteenth, Two-Thousand and One` was my golden birthday; I **\[self-proclaimedly\]** joined the ranks of man, gained my eternal freedom, and passed the driving test **\[insert Tim Taylor grunting noise\]**. `The events of that day would call themselves hectic if given the chance to speak`. My father, myself, and a friend spent many-an-hour trying to reattach the ground effects that `made` the car. Driveability was not overlooked, though:

1. Fluids. Check.
1. Lights. Check.
1. Carburetor adjustments. Check.

Many of the defining features that now exist weren't completed at the time, but the Z managed to look sharp **\[with fresh paint and clean lines\]** sans stripe kit, BF Goodrich Radial T/A's, and polished aluminum rims. My father is a true artist when it comes to the automobile, and it was certainly reflected in the craftsmanship of his work.  

Headed for my first gas-guzzling fill-up at one of the local pumps, I reversed out of the driveway - exhausted. `The memory of that first ride is so vivid I can feel angsty youth walk over my grave like a goose just recounting it`. The conscious state that exists because of pure-adrenaline and warm-fuzzies is one which has joyously overwhelmed me after completion, or failure, of every car project I've attempted.

Driving a vintage car can be assimilated to being a member of an exclusive club. Heads turn, people stare, and windows roll-down for inquiries on model and `general memory sharing across the yellow and white lines dividing us`. The standard automobile may go the way of the dodo, but I will always view the well-designed and character-containing steel behemoths as the keys to the world-at-my-feet mentality that goes hand-in-hand with a fresh road-trip.
