While the the southern states of the USA are more famously known for their junkyards of another era, I have found Colorado to be a hidden gem.  In what can only be described as our forefather's attempt at [Manifest Destiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_Destiny), generations of Americans **\[and family sedans\]** flocked here in search of their own piece of Earth. Nothing made it out alive.

Since Colorado has never used salt on their roads, many of the vehicles are only pock-marked with surface rust. Many pristine beasts lay still, complete with original interiors, waiting for a new owner to transform them into a mode of transportation again. The junkyards where they lay should be respectfully called front lawns; parking lots of mostly pre-1950's trucks, when rear quarter panels still retained curves. 

This place is the ultimate restorer's Heaven, and I plan to document my finds below **\[and maybe buy a couple\]**. 

I arrived in Denver two months ago without a legitimate camera, and I have wanted to punch myself in the face every time I saw a vehicle worthy of blogging.  Though I consider myself a "car guy", I lived in Chicago for most of my life; it simply does not offer the kind of off-road vehicle watching the mountains do **\[though I got to see a Tesla up close\]**.  I'm working on getting a DSLR, but for now I'll just post pictures of vehicles which I encounter for the first time **\[and maybe a blurb\]**.

<h2>[ford gt40]</h2>
I was walking down the street and noticed a hub-bub of people **\[who knew nothing about cars\]** around this.  I freaked.  After explaining to them the racing [legacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_GT40), one lady actually asked me what kind of car it was.  I pointed to the decals on the side :)  It truly is a striking car, regardless of Jeremy Clarkson's  [issues](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/jeremy_clarkson/article571088.ece) with it.  The owner even opened the rear-mounted hood for everyone!  I know this doesn't fit the off-road bill, but it's appreciable none-the-less.

<h2>[ford bronco]</h2>
I have always wanted a Bronco, but the Midwest is only full of rust-buckets.  I love the original paint on this thing along with the faded-white `FORD` insignia on the back.  It appears to have some early [Bushwacker](bushttp://www.bushwacker.com) fender flares, which I thought was a neat touch.
