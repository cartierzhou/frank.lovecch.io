title: Play! 2.0 Sass Parser Module
quote: Why is this so damned hard?

Play! Framework, 2.0 - bleeding. fucking. edge. Trying to develop for Play 2.0 with sparse documentation -- plus being new to Scala/SBT -- has not been easy.  The Eclipse plugin needs work (3 SBT commands plus refresh plus project clean...yuck), and the modules for sweet tools are still sparse.  

It seems like everything we write these days is just a clean, going-to-be-compiled, version of shit that's been around for a while; CoffeeScript, Backbone, SASS.  Once you've SASSED, it's hard to go back.
