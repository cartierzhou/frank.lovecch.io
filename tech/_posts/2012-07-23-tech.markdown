quote: On Getting the Gist of it.

When I was seventeen, I moved into the SRH freshman dormitory situated upon the West Campus of The University of Illinois-Chicago. My lifetime streak of never receiving less than a B grade on a report card ended shortly thereafter. As it happened, an XBOX t-shirt wearing, Linux preaching computer nerd moved into the room next to us (and I say that with the highest of regard). Steve wore a purple robe around the mixed-sex dorm, and I dubbed him 'Hef'; the name sticks to this day. 

I fell into computers via upgrades to the 'box my parents bought me for Christmas' (yea, that was a <i>Hackers</i> reference), and web development came when our newly formed hockey club needed a website. Hef guided me through using telnet, SSH, and an emacs terminal (all on a gross PC); my own personal <i>Introduction to Computer Science</i> had begun.

Six years later, I was hired on as a Junior Developer at a cloud-based machine-to-machine company. Per usual, I was in over my head. Things started to 'click' after about six months of sixty-hour work weeks, and I never looked back. These are my trials and tribulations as a daily developer; snippets of smidgens.
