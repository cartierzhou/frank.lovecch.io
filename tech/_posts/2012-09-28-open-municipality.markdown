Today, I was booted for the second time over the course of <i>nine</i> months. I've been at war with the Parking Magistrate Gods for years, now; they must have picked up my scent as I left Chicago, Westward bound. Instead of paying the imposed <i>fourteen-hundred</i> dollar fines, I am taking a stand.

<h1>Background</h1>
My family paid <i>three-hundred</i> dollars for a <i>nineteen ninety-five</i> Honda Civic when I was in college; it ran on two cylinders at the time. After a few hundred dollars in parts and a couple weekends of effor, my father and a friend got in running. The Civic became my daily driver, and it would be for years. Because it was a <a href="">ricer</a>, the police officers in my neighborhood <b>[also known as Little Italy]</b> didn't take kindly to it. 

As I was always doing some sort of modification, the front bumper was on and off the car relatively often. One day, I lost the front license plate. Immediately, we notified the <a href="">Secretary of State</a> and received a fax to put in my window until a replacement arrived. As you can imagine, the piece of paper in my windshield didn't stop me getting parking tickets for 'no front plate'. I received a ticket every day for a week-and-a-half until my new plate arrived. 

I sent a rebuttal letter for every one of those ten parking tickets, always including a copy of the piece of paper faxed from the Secretary of State. Half of the replies stated I was not liable, while the other half stated that I'd need to pay <b>[and at an increased amount because of the time passed]</b>. This is when I cracked.

<h1>The Fines</1>  `I finally fought back, but not by 'sticking it' to the the local government`. Instead, I wrote the first section of mobile application I've been mulling over for a while, finally inspired enough to get into <a href="">XCode</a>. 

<h1>Governments are Businesses</h1>
Money and politics are an awful combination. You know how you have those moments when you're at the DMV, trying to get a permit, or engaging in something generally horrific <b>[on a municipal level]</b>, and you find yourself asking, 'How is that even possible?'. Well, I'm really tired of the world not moving as fast as it should, and their being a lack of truly transparent operations. I've come to abhor politics and everyone involved with them, because honestly, voting and protesting should not be the only mainstream actions available to me. Our elected officers should have a first-hand, realtime account of what's going on. 

Setup to fail.
