A friend mentioned something about having encountered a man walking on his hands because he had no legs. `Obviously, the next logical progression led us to nugget porn`, which I can attest does not currently exist in easily attainable form. The conclusion: buy some domain names pertaining to the subject matter and sit on them until it becomes mainstream. `I think more backstory is necessary`.

In the Spring of _two-thousand and eight_, a group of us **\[mostly [SAE](http://sae.org) members\]** were hanging out at the university lab. Rarely was anything accomplished in those days beyond watching humorous videos on [YouTube](http://www.youtube). I don't remember _exactly_ how the conversation got started, but it came to and end after an unsuccessful _two_ hour hunt for nugget porn existence. We did find a parked domain, [nuggetporn.com](http://www.nuggetporn.com). `Sick bastards`.

What started out as a sudo-practical joke went full-circle. Originally, I told a good friend of mine I was going to buy his digital name, then link something crude. The worst, _legal_ content I could imagine was an `old-as-the-internet meme`: [goatse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse.cx). Then I remembered something: `With great power comes great responsibility`. I keep the domain renewed, just in case I need some clout over him; you never know, he may have to dance with the devil in the pail moonlight to make a deal for his `digital` soul.
