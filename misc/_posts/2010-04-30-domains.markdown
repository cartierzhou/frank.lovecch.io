Recently, I had a conversation with a fantastic female presence.  She mentioned something about having encountered a man walking on his hands, because he had no legs. Of course, the next logical progression led us to nugget porn; I can attest that it does not currently exist in easily attainable form.  The conclusion: buy some domain names pertaining to the subject matter and sit on them until nugget porn comes into mainstream.  I think more backstory is necessary.

In the Spring of 2008, a group of <a href="">SAE</a> members and myself were hanging out at the university lab. We rarely accomplished anything in those days beyond watching (horribly) funny videos on <a href="http://www.youtube">YouTube</a>, and while I don't remember how the conversation started, it ended in an unsuccessful two-hour hunt for nugget porn.  As far as I can tell, the only thing in existance is another parked domain, <a href="http://www.nuggetporn.com">nuggetporn.com</a>.

So, ya know, I got that going for me.

What started out as a sudo-practical joke has come full circle.  Originally, I told a good friend of mine I was going to buy his domain 'name', then post something lude on it.  The worst thing I could think of was the old-as-the-internet meme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse.cx">Goatse</a>, but then I remembered something:

"With great power comes great responsibility."

I have been trying to get him to move out to Colorado, his life-long dream.  For that to happen, he needs a job.  For a job to appropriate, he needs to be cleanly 'Googleable'.  As his birthday present, I told him I wouldn't put anything too scandalous up.  While I decide on which naked baby picture to post (the one with the most cheek), I will be reveling in the fact that I own his (internet) soul.
