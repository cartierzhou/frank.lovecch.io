In weeding through bookmarked links and items posted to my social networks in the past, I've aggregrated a `best of` list for those that continue to move me. Every once in a while, `when I clamour for a little soul-food pick-me-up`, I come back here, clicking with a vengeance. I hope you enjoy them as much as I have.

<h2>[blog/life/politics]</h2>

1. [Life as a Service](http://jacquesmattheij.com/life-as-a-service)
I don't think I could sum up my feelings on the general disposition of things as logically as is put forth.

1. [The Joy of Quiet](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/opinion/sunday/the-joy-of-quiet.html)
I've been questioned on the lack of TV/Internet at my home. Even though I work as a developer and value an internet connection, I have the ability to tether from my phone. Having a data-cap attributed to my cellular plan has kept me `in check` with what's really important.

1. [The Story of Stuff](http://www.storyofstuff.org/movies-all/story-of-stuff)
At some point, I stumbled upon the notion that it wasn't the material goods creating happiness in myself, but rather the experiences derived from - or attributed to - usage of the items. 

1. [The Sartorialist: Manners, January 2010](http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/a-graceful-man-a-gentleman/)
Growing up in the Midwest, my parents did their best to instill the concept of `manners` in me from a young age. I wasn't a lost cause by any means, but up until reading this blog post I hadn't become cognizant of their true impact. The world has been a better place since.

1. [The Sartorialist: Grace, March 2010](http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/a-walk-with-mr-barbera-milano/)
Part of what's lost on today's `bra/bro` culture is wrapped up in a few paragraphs. 

1. [It's Just a Ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUiwTubYu0)
There's something so soothing about hearing Bill speak the words `it's just a ride`. I may [yern](http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308) for the ancient heavenly connection and ponder our very existence **\[with utter failure\]**, but I never let it ruin the pleasure of simply `being`.

1. [The Buried Life List](https://www.facebook.com/tbl/app_6009294086)
Before their book was a bestseller, these kids were inspiring others **\[and me\]** to do what you feel. Who didn't make a `buried-life` list?

1. [Best Wedding Invitation Ever](http://metalmother.com/motherboard/index.php/2008/11/married)
I know _the best_ and _epic_ might be over-utilized in the English language, but reading this romantic infotation **\[infographic + invitation\]** always provides warmth when the sun isn't shining.

1. [Greek riots](http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/athens_12_15/a16_17333817.jpg)
This image of the Greek Riots from _two-thousand and ten_ proves one thing; `a picture really is worth a thousand words`. A single action, the simple offering of a flower, conveys the youth's stance. I am aghast at the men who defy such a peaceful statement.

1. [Happy People Dancing](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080722.html)
Love really can make you feel good.

1. [Free Cabin Porn](http://freecabinporn.com)
A constant creative stream chalk-full of dream-link cabins in places that probably don't exist. Try going to work after flipping through these.

<h2>[comedy]</h2>
1. [Dennis Quaid on Ellen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C64ZYuR7PuQ)
I've had dreams about walking into [Starbucks](http://starbucks.com) and shouting my name from the roof...er, to the Baristas.

1. [Creative Writing Assignment](http://www.kontraband.com/pics/22193/FW-FW-FW-Creative-Writing-Assignment)
The joys of working in a group.

1. [XKCD Thoughts](http://xkcd.com/275/)
If you are unknowledgable in XKCD, it's a webcomic geared towards nerds of subjects like math, science, computers, and love! I'm not sure how it works on a mobile device, but every cartoon typically has a hidden `hover` event when the mouse pointer is left over the comic. The particular thought in reference has crossed my mind before, and I can only wonder what a father's version of this comic would entail.

1. [Hellen Keller Simulator](http://helenkellersim.com)
There's a lot of people out there that don't find the new incarnation of the word retard funny; I'm not one of them. `What's a ratard?` The world has gotten a little too politically correct for itself, as being able to find humor in any subject is important. It's exactly what'd you'd expect.

1. [Boy Meets World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOpyK0qT8F8)
While I understand the correct, well-mannered response to something you missed in passing conversation is `Excuse me?`, I find myself blurting `they want you take the rolls` more often than not when the lines of communication get crossed.

<h2>[music]</h2>
1. [Passengers Break into Song](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Dont-Be-Afraid-During-Newark-Scare-Passengers-Break-into-Hey-Jude-80716192.html)
Something similar to this has oft been a part of fantasies for me. 

1. [Louis Prima &amp; Keely Hazel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAP9hC4GP_U&feature=related)
The dynamic of these _two_ is best represented here. Wait for the tone change.

1. [Arthur Connely](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhCoDd21QpE)
`Nobody leaves here without singing the blues`, or in this case - soul. This is the kind of music I want to hear on a Friday night. Aside from that, the audience's fashion stylings are a reminder that the `hipster` existed _fifty_ years prior, at least in terms of wardrobe. 

1. [Judy Garland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yudgy30Dd68)
Whenever I'm feeling melancholic and missing loved ones in different places, I turn to Judy. It might not be Christmas, but the melody always brings that season to life - a time when I _do_ get to see them.
