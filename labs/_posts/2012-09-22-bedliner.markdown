title: Bedliner.
quote: Truth, beauty, and two-part epoxy.

There are a few things in life which I swear by:  Truth, Beauty, and _bed-liner_.  Industrial epoxy coatings are used everywhere - floors, exterior surfaces, and yes - truck beds. There are so many applications in which it could be used cost effectively, so what's stopping us?  Follow me in my journey as I apply bedliner to everything I can think of.
