I first heard of Kevin Rose my freshman year in college after being shown an episode of [The Broken](http://thebroken.org) by my robe-wearing, computer-nerd mentor. For those unfamiliar, the _three_ episode series chronicled hacking in various aspects ranging from social to technical; `and they always did so with 40's of beer in hand`. Rose would eventually go onto drinking good beer on the [Digg](http://digg.com), but it never seemed to capture the spirit emanating from the lousily-shot series prior. 

I've always wanted to do a [maker](http://maker.com) video series that had similar traits as _The Broken_, and I'm working on putting together _six_ videos for _two-thousand and thirteen_. Stay tuned.
